## Lecture 1
He briefly introduces the concepts and what will be covered. He then show an interesting paradox that is solved by the fact that while the English question is the same for all, the mathematical question is different since for each solution we changed the [[Sample Space\|Sample Space]] in subtle ways.

In so doing, he "mata a dos parajos con un tira" (kill two birds with one stone) by showing the importance of rigorous probability definitions, and showing the importance of always planting a problem properly (and to ensure the Sample Space is clear to everyone.)

## Lecture 2-3
I skipped them. I am already familiar with cardinality and countability.

[[Cardinality\|Cardinality]]
[[Countability\|Countability]]
