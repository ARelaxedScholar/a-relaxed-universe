# StatQuest ~ Neural Networks ! Deep Learning
## Episode 1 ~ The Essential Main Ideas of Neural Networks
Machine Learning is nothing more and nothing less than curve-fitting. What is the most flexible but simple curve you can use to fit a curve to any arbitrary dataset? Ding-Ding-Ding a [[1. Cosmos/Neural Networks\|neural network]].

Josh Stalmer--a gift to humanity--carries us through the fundamentals of Neural Networks, explaining what they are and motivating their use. Honestly I already knew most of the material, but I am watching this playlist to relax and create a soil of knowledge for when I read it later. As I am writing this I am reading [[2. White Holes/References/Understanding Deep Learning\|Understanding Deep Learning]], and following [[2. White Holes/References/Practical Deep Learning for Coders\|Practical Deep Learning for Coders]] (already finished Part 1 once) so yeah, I will be learning and re-learning the same concepts from multiple sources. 

Should be fun tho!

By the way, Big Fancy Squiggle Fitting Machine (BFSFM) has to be my new favourite name for anything ever lmao.
