The first lesson starts slowly with the basics, we are introduced with the most fundamental regression technique [[1. Cosmos/Simple Linear Regression\|Simple Linear Regression]], and we set the tempo. We will not be dawdling, by the end of the lesson we have seen how to derive the formula for the estimators in the simple case, how to derive the formula for the different inference techniques, and the distribution of the different parameters involved.

The course will be fast-paced.

We start by reviewing simple linear regression.

We then take the rest of the period to explore [[1. Cosmos/Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\|Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)]] after briefly introducing multiple linear regression.

## [Lecture 3](https://uottawa-ca.zoom.us/rec/play/u95zJzJFDv3avtN155Yj7umcc8wglINICRqJm13qizyCjD2_dnHhhtc_Rio_GQJMeXQCjuZPCsmY6eq8.Aox29xcFdY3FcSSo )
We directly start with [[1. Cosmos/Multiple Linear Regression\|Multiple Linear Regression]].
Which can be seen as a generalization of [[1. Cosmos/Simple Linear Regression\|Simple Linear Regression]].

Since it would quickly become unwieldy to do the same kind of algebra we did for simple linear algebra, on arbitrarily many parameters, it is a pressing issue to find a way to do calculations once so that they will apply to any number of parameters.

And what better way to do that than to resort to [[Linear Algebra\|Linear Algebra]] and matrices? Indeed, [[1. Cosmos/Multiple Linear Regression\|Multiple Linear Regression]] makes full use of matrices and matrix calculus to derive it's formulas. In this lesson we cover that, and 
go over the formulas to remember for each part.

We start seeing generalization of [[1. Cosmos/Multiple Linear Regression\|Multiple Linear Regression]].

More specifically, how do we deal with [[Categorical Data\|Categorical Data]].
