# My Values as An Artist

1. Christianity (I'm a christian, I don't want to necessarily make "christian" music, but I don't want to write stuff that could be misconstrued as something else.)
2. Multilingualism (I love languages, and I am learning languages as I do this. I want to write music that cleverly uses the languages I learned)
3. Empathy (I want to write music that goes deep and that gives a voice ti the unheard, that depicts things in a way that encapsulates all that one may feel in a RAW and real way. I want people to listen to my music and be like "damn, that's me") As a result while some songs will be about me, I want my songs to cover experiences I haven't had to live. Hence "kamikamen", anyone could be behind the mask.
