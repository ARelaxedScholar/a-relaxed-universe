# What is a RSS?
A RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a format for doing [[syndication\|syndication]]. It is cool because it does not put any restriction on what can be syndicated, anything from blog posts, to podcast episodes, to news and more is fair game. The original version was released in MarchÂ 15, 1999, and the latest version came out in March 30, 2009.  

# What is a RSS feed?
It is XML feed with a lot of information. The feed doesn't make any statement, it just contains data and leaves the displaying to the RSS reader. It is really convenient as it can be used to stay up-to-fluff with social media stuff, without having to bathe in all the cancer and to have all your stuff (news, podcasts, etc.) in one place. Almost all PODCAST apps (except maybe Spotify) use RSS.

It is especially useful because it makes you not have to waste time going to the frontend of a billion different websites. Instead, saving all in one place and reading (without having to worry about noise like ads, unwanted comment, etc.)
