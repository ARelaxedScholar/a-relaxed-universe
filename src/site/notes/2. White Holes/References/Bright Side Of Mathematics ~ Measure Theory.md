# Bright Side Of Mathematics ~ Measure Theory

## Lecture 4 ~ Not Everything Is Lebesgue Measurable
I am currently following a class in Foundations of Probability [[MAT3172\|MAT3172]] for my degree and I have been needing to supplement my lectures with Youtube. I have discovered an inkling for measure theory.

I have already watched a few lectures, but I will start taking notes at lesson 4 cause why not?

Here he does exactly what the title  suggests. He proves that one cannot define a Lebesgue measure on $2^\varOmega$.
### Lesson Points:
[[1. Cosmos/Lebesgue Measures\|Lebesgue Measures]]

## Lecture 5 ~ Measurable Maps
Here he explains what measure maps are. Honestly, besides what he has explained I am having some difficulties seeing what their point is, but it should make more sense in the next lecture.
