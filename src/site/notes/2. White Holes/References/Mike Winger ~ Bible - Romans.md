## Why Christian Extremism Is Good?
Really quickly. He basically says that Christian extremism is good because someone who is a Christian to the extreme, will know better than to do *insert bad thing*.

While the term "extremism" is loaded by default, because of its association with other groups, and what we typically observe of those extremists, he makes the case that while, in many of those other groups those bad things are an expected result of following their sources as they were intended, in Christianity a proper reading of the text will lead the Christian to be serving to the extreme, loving to the extreme, truth-teller to the extreme (which combined with the latter point would imply having tact), etc. That was a long sentence.

This is an interesting view... I don't know if I agree with the argument as stated, but given the Bible tells you that the lukewarm-ones will be spat out (Revelations 3:16-18), it does stand to reason to want to be closer to boiling than the alternative. 

I think fundamentally I don't like this because it seems to me that Christianity is more binary than that, like there might be theological disagreements, there might be--at times--multiple valid interpretations of the same verses, but either you practice the Bible's teachings (or at least you're trying your damned best and failing) or you are not.

In other words, either your faith is alive (you might be struggling with sin still) but you are doing your best to walk with God, or you totally abandoned walking with God and just call yourself Christian, if that.

So while there's definitely a spectrum for a few things like [[Sanctification\|Sanctification]], [[Anointing\|Anointing]], [[Gifts\|Gifts]], the person on that spectrum is either Christian or they are not. I am writing this at 1am though, so let me brew over this and come back to you.

Besides that, he covers a few things, but the one that resonated with me the most was the calling to sanctification (which is why it's filled.) I am creating the others to fill in on other occasions.
