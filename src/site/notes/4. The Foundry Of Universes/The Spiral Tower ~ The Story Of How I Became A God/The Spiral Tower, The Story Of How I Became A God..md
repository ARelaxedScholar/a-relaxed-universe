On the day of his fated marriage, an Imperial Prince is torn from his love, Solana, and thrust into the enigmatic Tower of Babel. Bridging the mortal and divine realms, its summit has never been reached. To reunite with Solana, he must achieve the impossible. With arcane allies, he unravels ancient mysteries, discovering his own purpose. But who or what wields such celestial power? As he ascends, the Prince unravels the tapestry of destiny, redefining reality itself. In a tale of love, sacrifice, and the pursuit of the unattainable, he challenges gods and mortals, seeking to breach the Tower and reclaim his love.

I am Orosei by the way. You might know me from Discord already.
