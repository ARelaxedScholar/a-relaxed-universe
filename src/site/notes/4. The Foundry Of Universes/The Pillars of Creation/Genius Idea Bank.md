- Walking the talk is really important. But often shutting the fuck up and just walking is better.
	- Manifestation
    **Topic** - What are you writing about from The Queue?
    Walking the talk is really important. But often shutting the fuck up and just walking is better.
    
    **Braindump** - Write out everything that comes to mind. A summary in a way that you understand at this point in your life.
    - People often make the accomplishment of their projects much more difficult by telling irrelevant people about it.
    - The power of moving in silence is that all those who want you to fail cannot sabotage something they aren't aware of.
    - We often talk about the power that accountability give you, what sharing your projects online does is also tie the success of your project to your social image. You look goofy.
    - There is pretty much no project that you can't complete by shutting up and doing the work, not everyone needs to know what you are doing unless you are doing it for that.
    - Sometimes not knowing that something is supposedly impossible is how you see success in a new uncharted land
    - When others hear about it, your image is tied to it. If your image is that of a loser, you might self-sabotage yourself to reinforce said image. Moving in silence allows you to ignore what others think of your.
    -  Not being constantly yapping about what you are doing means that you only get dopamine of it from working.
    
    **References** - Are there any quotes, books, or other content that comes to mind?
    - That Bible verse about the king that revealed where all the treasures in his kingdom were and that got Israel ransacked.
    - The verse about how a foolish person can look intelligent if they stfu.
    - Had Odysseus not told Polyphemus where he lived, the entire story would have been avoided.
    - The verse about your tongue being from hell.
    
    **Big Problem** - What is the main problem and how has it impacted your life or others’ lives?
    - not being disciplined with how one speaks is the quickest way to ruin one's life.
    - Too many fail in their projects because they got the input of too many unrelated people which diluted the original vision
    
    **Big Benefit** - What’s in it for me? Why should I solve this problem?
    - Focus
    - Discipline on one's body and being able to control ourselves.
    
    **Objections** - How do people talk themselves out of solving this problem for themselves?
    - It is not that big of a deal!
    - I am doing it to get accountability!
    - I need feedback about my idea.
    
    **Personal Experience** - Have you experienced the problem or benefit? What’s the story behind that?
    - In my personal experience, there is pretty much none of my projects that benefitted from me telling a bunch of people. Either I wouldn't complete them which meant it was then awkward, and even assuming it does not hinder, discussing it does not help in the achievement of the task.
    
    **Frameworks** - Can you create a memorable, step-by-step solution to solving the problem?
    1. Think about your idea
    2. Understand why talking about your ideas in public is not a good thing
    3. Find an alternative to still get those ideas out (journalling)
    4. Work in silence, journaling for the feedback you need.

	- Manifestation
    **Topic** - What are you writing about from The Queue?
    
    **Braindump** - 
    - You can only do what you see yourself doing unless compelled to do otherwise by an external force.
    - The Bible tells us we were made in the image of God, at a metaphysical level this means we have the ability to bring into existence what our minds can conceive.
    - Someone that sees themselves as a linguist will do all he can to study languages, someone that fails to do so.
    - Sometimes seeing yourself as something is the only thing between you and that thing.
    - Faking till you make it is based entirely on this idea, force your mind to see yourself succeeding by faking success.
    
    **References** - Are there any quotes, books, or other content that comes to mind?
    - it is from the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks (Bible paraphrase)
    - Research about alcoholic having a much better chance to stop if they stop identifying as retired alcoholics.
    
    **Big Problem** - What is the main problem and how has it impacted your life or others’ lives?
    - People have a problem identifying with the things that are needed to reach the goal they want to reach
