- half the time if you want to seem smart learn things before they do.  
- standing vs sitting in the bus, why do I prefer standing in general?  
- existence requires an observer  
- if existence requires an observer it makes perfect sense that God is triune. As within the being you'd have 2 beings in relation, and one to realize the relationship. More than that is not useful as they just see relationships that are already clear to the three.

- How to make the next quantum leap in your career using abstractions?  
- What is the difference between abstractions and vagueness?
- Artificial Intelligence has as much intelligence as you the user can bestow it., it might not be as intelligent as a human IQ wise, but with the right tools it can be superhuman.
- Mathematics is made to be the end-all be all of AI, but you don't ever really need it for application most of the time.
- Everything in your life is either under your control, or controls you.
- Working on projects is the best way to develop skills
- Getting a research team and more than that a team of die hard fans is really important
- It is often not that difficult to get where you want to get, the difficul thing is staying consistent while on the way.
- Competition is so low in this day and age that it really does not take much to be exceptional
- Consistency is the most important thing in success
- There is often a significant difference between what you think is interesting and what others need. You should find the intersection between the two.

- In order of importance, God -> Family -> Friends -> Health -> Freedom -> Money. Do not accept golden shackles
- One of the most amazing things about technology is how it enabled us to disconnect place of living and connectivity. This is both a good thing and a bad thing.

- Becoming skilled is about how much of time you are able to do whatever you need.
- There is something powerful about a man that does not care about how others define how he should be.
- Men and women are not the same. This not a bad thing, but acting under the assumptions that they are is not.
- Life has many opportunities and these opportunities often exist right within your reach. The difference between you capitalizing on them is simply knowing about them.
- There's no shame in copy. The shame is in mindless copy. Take, improve, if you do not improve, learn, if you do not improve repurpose, if you do not repurpose learn. Copying for copying leads to stagnation.
