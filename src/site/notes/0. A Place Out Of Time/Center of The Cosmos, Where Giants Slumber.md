# Center of The Cosmos, Where Giants Slumber
Woah, you have reached this place.

Well I am humbled that you are reading this, really!
This is my cosmic space, where I garden planets and share my knowledge... at least the little I have.

I am Kouakou Jedidiah Ange-Emmanuel, and I often go by "ARelaxedScholar" on technical forums. I like the idea of being a well-read expert, but we're still on the trail. You might know me as Orosei on Discord.

This here is my little chunk of the internet, where I will write notes about concepts as I learn them, revisit them as I need to, write my thoughts (that can be shared) here, etc, etc. 

I'll also be writing fiction at a really slow burn pace, as my other obligations allow.

Finally, you'll be able to see in real time the projects that I am tackling and their progress. 

Stay a while and read. I hope this can be helpful to you.

Keep in mind, these are my personal notes and are therefore very informal. Do not expect scholarly prose, or whatnot. It might occur, but most of the time it will not.

They will capture things as I think them, and are the place where my content creation ideas will take form.
