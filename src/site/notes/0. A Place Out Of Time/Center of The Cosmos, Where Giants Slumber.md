# Center of The Cosmos, Where Giants Slumber
Woah, you have reached this place.

Well I am humbled that you are reading this, really!
This is my cosmic space, where I garden planets and share my knowledge... at least the little I have.

I am Kouakou Jedidiah Ange-Emmanuel, and I often go by "ARelaxedScholar" on technical forums. I like the idea of being a well-read expert, but truthfully we're not there yet. You might know me as Orosei on Discord.

This here is my little chunk of the internet, where I will write notes about concepts as I learn them, revisit them as I need to, write my thoughts (that can be shared) here, etc, etc. 

I'll also be writing fiction at a really slow burn pace, as my other obligations allow.

Finally, you'll be able to see in real time the projects that I am tackling and their progress. 

Stay a while and read. I hope this can be helpful to you.

Keep in mind, these are my personal notes and are therefore very informal. Do not expect scholarly prose, or whatnot. It might occur, but most of the time it will not.
## Topics
Work In Progress (Will turn tags that centralize notes into MOCS as I go)
## Mini Essays ~ 
Keep in mind that stuff linked here is not necessary complete. These are sparks of ideas that I will work on as I get the time to do so.

### University Courses
[Data Science Course Sequence ~ Anticipated Graduation : 2026-2027](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/undergraduate-studies/programs/data-science/course-sequence)
Down here you'll find notes for the classes I took. Due to the way I like to knead the content of lectures into the greater "interstellar dough" of my notes *(should have done a web analogy but shh)*, the "Lesson Points" section of each lecture might not always be laser-focused on the content of the class. The point is more so to give a holistic picture of what I felt was important. I won't take notes that I won't reread, so stuff that I felt like I already knew well enough will not be explained more than needed. 

I think it is important to say I see notes as a tool for learning rather than an end in itself. Indeed, it's only recently that I have started taking notes in any sort of consistent manner, until now coasting through school by purely listening. Even now listening constitutes the bulk of my learning and I use notes mostly as a way to keep track of what I learned, so that I could have notes to revisit if I ever needed to relearn a subject at some point.

For those reasons, I do not (and will not) be having dedicated note hubs for ALL my classes.

Still, I hope this can be useful to someone.

### Personal Learning
This here will be the notes for all my scholarly pursuits that are not directly tied to a university course. They might have been prompted by university classes, and for that reason there will surely be some correlation, but they are notes on material I consulted on my own time. Yet again, they will most likely not be exhaustive.

Some series I will watch up to a point, and then stop because I have done getting what I needed from them.

Some books I will drop because they are simply not that interesting.

Some textbooks I will abandon because they are too technical and not yet at a level I can grasp.

Some ressources...

You get the gist. I will only go so far as I feel like I need.
