# Inverted Spectrum Problem

Everyone can see colors.

Imagine we flip the spectrum of colors, and one person sees the colors following the original spectrum and the second sees the second inverted spectrum.

Since from the beginning of their life, they are raised to know what each colors are (even though they see perfectly distinct and different colors) to be the same thing, then in if that were to happen, we'd have no way to know which spectrum they're seeing.

If they walked around us right now, we'd never know.

The problem is esentially that even two identical brains, there's nothing that would allow us to infer what kind of color relations they have. At least right now.

Apparently the [[1. Cosmos/Yoneda Lemma\|Yoneda Lemma]] can solve that problem.

The idea in a gist, is that colors lie on spectrum. Through testing we can see that all colors are broken down into 4 color poles (two pairs), each respective pair inhibits each other. Blue and Yellow, and Green and Red. This forces a 2D structure in which all other colors must lie, except NOT. Since there's also a light component to light, another axis must be added one going from pure darkness, to pure lightness with everything else in between.

Result we obtain a sphere of colors. Using that sphere of color, and math we can calculate precisely (as in with actual numbers) the distance between colors, and somehow those distances are unique per color (which means they can be treated as associations). Since they can be treated that way, the Yoneda lemma tells us that two colors are only truly identitical if going through this process, you obtain the same relational distance from colors to color, extrapolating this further you are able to see if two people truly see the same colors.

Furthermore, the [[1. Cosmos/Yoneda Lemma\|Yoneda Lemma]] disproves the Inverted Spectrum Problem by showing it to be mathematically impossible for a person A and B to be labeling the same colors as the same things (sharing the same perception of the distance between these colors) while having an inverted perception, since if mine and your conception of red differs, the distance from my red to my blue would be different than yours.
