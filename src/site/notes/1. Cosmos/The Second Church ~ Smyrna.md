# The Second Church ~ Smyrna

They haven't committed a sin perse, rather they are calomnied by others around them. And Jesus (the one who holds the seven stars and seven chandeliers) tell them that they will face adversities for 10 days (which is probably a prophetic 10 day rather than a 24-hour-10 days.)
