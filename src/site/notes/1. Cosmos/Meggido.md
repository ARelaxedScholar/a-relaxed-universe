# [[1. Cosmos/Meggido\|Meggido]] 
## What is Meggido?
Ok so I had assumed Meggido to be a simple city or something that for some reason appeared in pop culture. It was indeed a really important city, and a spot both important from an historical, cultural and theological standpoint. In the [[Bronze Age\|Bronze Age]], it was a Canaanite city and during the [[Iron Age\|Iron Age]] it was a Royal City of Israel. This is interesting to know as it allows us to situate the book of Judges/Juges between these two ages, so somewhere around 1200 BC. 
## Why the heck did it appear in Tensura Slime?
It's likely a combination of these two reasons. First, because the Battle of End days will take place in a location called [[Armaggedon\|Armaggedon]], which is believed by many to be [[Har Meggido\|Har Meggido]], a mountain located in Meggido. The second reason, is that while [[1. Cosmos/Meggido\|Meggido]] in Hebrew means something (Cut/Invade?), when translated to Koine Greek, it becomes Armaggedon. And Armaggedon being the location of the end of war, it has with time become a shorthand to refer to the end of the world, even if it was supposed to be a location.

The author of Slime was likely aware of that, and simply referred to that [[Armaggedon\|Armaggedon]] idea when he named Rimuru's move Meggido. Especially considering how gruesome it was,and how that move was literally the one used to decimate an entire army during a war, where a deity (Rimuru) showed his anger towards the sinners who had dared attack his kingdom and even reap the lives of his followers. This seemed to be the image, the author was going for. The similes go even further, as the enemy can be seen to be like Satan, a king who uses an otherwordly power (of isekai heroes) to attain his own goals, as opposed to Rimuru who basically lives a life as a benevolent god (demon lord, actually) improving the life of his followers. I am likely reading too much into it, but it seems clear at least part of this was the intent of the author. ![Pasted image 20230902103534.png](/img/user/The%20Vault/Media/Pasted%20image%2020230902103534.png)
