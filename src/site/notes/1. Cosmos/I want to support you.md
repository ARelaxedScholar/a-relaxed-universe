# I want to support you
(0:12)
Wednesday, I knew you weren't okay
I couldn't bear to face it. I wonder when...

I will stop running away

Today, I sworn that on this day. 
At the place where the birds of clay.
Go to die, I will rebirth, yeaaahh

Your gaze so bright. A light so pure.
This gave me license to ignore.
To throw the weight, to shift the blame
Oh, what a pain...

I am.
The one who fell for you.
You know it's true.
But I don't know why.
I don't know what.
You saw in me, that made you think.
That made you want to reciprocate 

(Ooh)

You are the radiant sun. The radiant one. 
The rainbow and the pot of gold all at once.
So bright, so pure, so strong, so sure.
But that's not fair.

(Ooh)
(1:10)
You bore the weight, I held your hand. 
A smile on both of o-u-r faces, as we-e went. Didn't know what that face meant.

But it's clear now, that I should have known.
Recognized all the signs you shown, oh yeah,  you shone.
Oh damned me, I should have known.

A mask of confidence. A fool that's lost in the dance.
I couldn't be there| for you| I was your unravelling.

Oh. 

I am.
The one who fell for you.
You know it's true.
But I don't know why.
I don't know what.
You saw in me, that made you think.
That made you want to reciprocate 

(So)

I will become the shining one.
The glowing sun. The thing that caught your eye that day.
I will not bend, will not relent, before the pain.
Yeah.


I want you to rest on me (I'll be there.)
I want you to rest on me (You're not alone anymore)
I want you to rest on me (I want you rest anymore)
