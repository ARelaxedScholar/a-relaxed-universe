# Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
First, what? That's what URL means!?

Second, yeah. The URL is the brainchild of Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of [[1. Cosmos/Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)\|Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)]], the [[1. Cosmos/Hypertext Protocol (HTTP)\|Hypertext Protocol (HTTP)]] and the URL is a key element for HTTP which tells us where any resource irrespective of type (hence uniform) is located, and so in a consistent format (uniform). In day to day life, a URL typically point to an html document constituting a website, but it could easily point to a server or some socket.
