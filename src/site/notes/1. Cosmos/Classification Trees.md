# Classification Trees

typically split using [[Gini Index\|Gini Index]] or [[Entropy (Deviance)\|Entropy (Deviance)]] since they are more sensitive (and therefore useful for growing a tree) than classification error which is not sensitive enough.

The classification is made based on the mode at each level.
