# Borel Sets
A Borel set is defined by its appartenance to a [[1. Cosmos/Borel-Sigma Algebras\|Borel-Sigma Algebras]]. They are also called Borel measurable sets to put emphasis on that fact.t

They are the subsets ([Events]) to which we assign probabilities in [[1. Cosmos/Continuous Probability Spaces\|Continuous Probability Spaces]]. Interestingly it is really difficult to define a set that is not a [[1. Cosmos/Borel Sets\|Borel set]]. Such sets exist, but you must go out of your way to define them after all if a set can be represented as the countable unions or intersections of open intervals or closed intervals, it is Borel.
