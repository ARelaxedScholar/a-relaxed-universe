# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

This is a kind of model that was extensively used before [[1. Cosmos/Transformers\|transformers]] came into force.

They are a special kind of neural networks that work on sequences and output sequences, instead of the traditional working on something and outputting some value.

They had a few problems:
- Slow for long sequences
- Vanishing/exploding gradient problem 
- Long-term dependency issues
