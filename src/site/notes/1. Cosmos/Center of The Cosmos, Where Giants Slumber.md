# Center of The Cosmos, Where Giants Slumber

Woah, you have reached this place.

Well I am humbled that you are reading this, really!
This is my cosmic space, where I garden planets and share knowledge.

I will write notes about concepts as I learn them, revisit them as I need to, write my thoughts (that can be shared) here, etc, etc.

Stay a while and read. I hope this can be helpful to you.
