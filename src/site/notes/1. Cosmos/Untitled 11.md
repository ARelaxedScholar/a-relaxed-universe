# Untitled 11

Been dreaming bout strolls in a nice car, where would I go? Didn't think that far.
Ghosts of a glorious past, galloping towards the future.
Big dreams contained in a jar, the train already left. Au revoir.
Still wish you'd have come to see me, leave. <-

Archenemy, wounded by my own thoughts, there's so many.
Devil in a walled garden, it's Getsemani
I didn't know, wanted to show, wanted to grow. 
Wanted to leave the house, got the whole world to see.

Whole world to see, my own odyssey. Travelling the sea.
A joke I can't swim, Still did it on a whim.
That's why I'm contrite, my budget's too tight.

A little too dumb, That's why I'm glad I couldn't string you along.

Along, that's a lie. If you were here with me, it wouldn't even scare me to die.
Iiiiii-I can't cry. Memories of your laughter besides me, a sun killing the clouds.

Been dreaming bout strolls in our old car, where would we go? Somewhere not too far.
A lake, some pizza, you'd sing, and I'd play the guitar.
A few kids, an husky named Scar, or a great dane called the Black star
Maybe you didn't want to see see me, leave. <-

[1:15]
I reminisce, what did I miss.
Lost in my dreams, broke you to pieces

I wanted to go, towards tomorrow.
Tomorrow is here, it feels so morose-uh

I-I-I killed our dream, to catch the stars.
Killed our dreams to slay dragons, 
Tomorrow's here, the night's still young.

[1:33]
I remember, memories so tender.
Oh how I long, the way we used to banter [around the fire]
Sitting all alone, a moonless night. 
Aiming for the stars, it seems that I lost my light.

I-I-I killed our dream, to catch the stars.
Killed our dreams, to chase waggons
Tomorrow's here, but the sun is gone, (oh).

Been dreaming bout strolls in a nice car, where would I go? Didn't think that far.
Ghosts of a glorious past, galloping towards the future.
Big dreams contained in a jar, the train already left. Au revoir.
Still wish you'd have come to see me, leave. 

Been dreaming bout strolls in a nice car, where would I go? Didn't think that far.
Didn't think I'd leave behind my home, behind my heart.
Big dreams contained in a jar, the train already left. Cest trop tard.
Still wish you'd have come to see me, leave.
