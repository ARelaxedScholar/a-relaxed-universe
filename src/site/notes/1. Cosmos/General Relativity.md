# General Relativity

An Astrophysics model assumes that the spacetime can be curved. It is a generally well accepted model of astrophysics since it explains how gravity works, predicts how black holes should work, etc.

However, we **know** it can't be true, since it clashes with another very well known and confirmed model of relatity called [[1. Cosmos/Diary/To Revisit/Quantum Mechanics\|Quantum Mechanics]].

There's also the problem of singularities, which is a telltale sign of a theory needing to be replaced.

Finally, there's the problem of [[1. Cosmos/Diary/To Revisit/Hawking's Radiation\|Hawking's Radiation]] which I honestly do not understand enough to explain.
