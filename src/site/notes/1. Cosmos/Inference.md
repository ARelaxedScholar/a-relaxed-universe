# Inference
Inference is a supremely important concept in statistics which refers to the idea of making judgments and drawing conclusions from the results of our data.

Without inference statistics are fundamentally useless. 

Things like 

[[1. Cosmos/Hypothesis Test\|Hypothesis Test]]
[[Confidence Intervals\|Confidence Intervals]]
[[Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\|Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)]]

are all kinds of inferences which allow us to learn more about our data.
