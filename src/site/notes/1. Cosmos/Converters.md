# Converters
A mill that does only the stuff after the greige goods. So they buy unusable as is fabric from Yarning Mills and then with inhouse processes will turn that greige good into a specific form of textile. Why specific? The same way designers and artists have styles, converters also have styles and they will produce a given type of textile.

They do less work than [[1. Cosmos/Vertical Mills\|Vertical Mills]] who do everything from scratch, but are much different from [[1. Cosmos/Distributers\|Distributers]].
