# Basic Supply Chain
1. A farmer, cultivator, whatever will produce the raw fiber
2. It is sent to a Yarning Mill, who will yarn the mill and turn it to greige goods.
3. The greige goods will be treated so that it becomes usable for actually wearable clothes, at the end of the process they either become [[PFD - Prepared for Dying\|PFD - Prepared for Dying]] or [[PFP - Prepared for Printing\|PFP - Prepared for Printing]].  This can be the end of the process, since designers who have custom prints or who want custom dyes can buy it at this stage to do their stuff.
4. After that further refining can be done to add features to a fabric, say coating for waterproofing.
