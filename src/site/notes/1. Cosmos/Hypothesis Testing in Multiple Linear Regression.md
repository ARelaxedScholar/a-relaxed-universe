# Hypothesis Testing in Multiple Linear Regression

There are levels to this. The only point of a model is to do inference on it, and for us to do that, we proceed carefully.

## 1. Check that our model is significant at all (Entire Set of Parameters) ~ Butcher Knife

## 2.a If is significant, check which individual parameters are significant (One Parameter at a Time) ~ Paring Knife
[[1. Cosmos/Test On Individual Regression Coefficient (Assuming We know our Model Is Significant)\|Test On Individual Regression Coefficient (Assuming We know our Model Is Significant)]]

## 2.b You think some parameters are useless, check for all of them at the same time. (A Few at A Time) ~ Chef Knife
