# Sample Space
[[1. Cosmos/Sample Space\|A sample space]], typically denoted $\varOmega$, represents the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. 

For example, if I toss a coin once, **a possible and natural sample space** would be $\varOmega = \{H, T\}$, but observe that the experiment does not **force** the sample space. As in multiple totally valid sample spaces exist for a given random experiment, and me the--data scientist--is the one that chooses what my sample space is.

If instead, I am interested in how many times the coin tumbles in the air, even though the random experiment is the same (tossing a coin once), the sample space would now be $\varOmega = \{1,2,3,\dots\} = \mathbb N$.

Therefore, the sample space is defined both by the [[Random Experiment\|random experiment]] and the thing of interest.

The random of *random experiment* comes from the fact that the outcomes have an associated [[Probability\|probability]] and that we cannot control which $\omega-$labelled marble we draw from our big bag called $\varOmega$.
