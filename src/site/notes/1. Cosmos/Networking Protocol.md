# Networking Protocol
This is the agreed grammar of the "language" which defines how two nodes decide to communicate. These are the rules which define how two nodes will communicate.

Communication involves three elements:
- Source
- Destination
- Media

The protocol is the set of rules built to account for:
- The identified sender and receiver
- Enforcing a specific language
- Speed and timing of the delivery
- The acknowledgement/confirmation requirements.
