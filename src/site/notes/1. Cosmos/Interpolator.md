# Interpolator

This is what does the blending between two vertices. 

It does the job of smoothing the transition between two vertices, no matter what data you feed in (normals, colors, etc.) In GLSL you can decide to turn it off.

## Barycentric Interpolation
Just an interpolation between 3 vertices.
