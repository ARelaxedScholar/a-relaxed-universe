# Stuff about fire and Jesus

# So fire, what is it?

I mean scientifically it's a process, it's an oxidation reaction where ions are stolen from a material by oxygen. And fire just happens to be a violent form of that oxidation reaction akin to a slow explosion.

But what are the things fire can do, a non exhaustive list
- purifies
- helps to cook
- burns & kill
- allows to work metals (and purify them)
- allows to identify metals by using their melting point
- it lights the darkness
- and warms us
- etc.

The Bible tells us that Jesus is that fire, and thus gives us a pretty poignant visualization of what Jesus is.
