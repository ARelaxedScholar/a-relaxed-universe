# Why Did God Place the Tree of Good and Evil in the Garden?

I often hear that God placed it in [[Eden\|Eden]] so that we'd have free-will. This feels like a cope out.

So why then? The closest I have to an explanation is the idea of virtue and challenge. Good is only virtuous if there's the opportunity to do evil (or if the agent doing good thinks there's another option,) there's only love if there's hate as a concept to delineate it.

The world is made of "Is" and "Is-Not", the tree was likely put there so that in due time they'd eat it, but it was also put there as an opportunity for virtue.

Now why test someone you know will fail? After all God had to know Adam wasn't ready, no? Well, yeah. 

A few elements of answer that:
- Man would have failed anyway (not a good explanation imo, since it means that man was vowed to fail and was given a task it couldn't fulfill. But 1 Corinthians 10:13-15 (technically, Adam and Eve were the first to be challenged, but He won't let you be tried beyond what you can bear))
- Adam could have succeeded but didn't (True, he was given the knowledge and the assignment. But when Eve gave him the fruit, the Bible makes no statement about him objecting. So he choked. Did he accept it because he is spineless, or because he wanted to follow his wife? Not clear, but if it's the latter then Adam implicitly had a choice between God and his wife and chose to follow his wife's word. He also failed to take accountability for it when asked.)
