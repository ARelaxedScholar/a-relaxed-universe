# Why Did God Place the Tree of Good and Evil in the Garden?

I often hear that God placed it in [[Eden\|Eden]] so that we'd have free-will. I think that this is partly true, but that is also deeply unsatisfying.

So why then? The closest I have to an explanation is the idea of virtue and challenge. Good is only virtuous if there's the opportunity to do evil (or if the agent doing good thinks there's another option,) there's only love if there's hate as a concept to delineate it.

The world is made of "Is" and "Is-Not", the tree was likely put there so that in due time they'd eat it, but it was also put there as an opportunity for virtue.

Now why test someone you know will fail? After all God had to know Adam wasn't ready, no? Well, yeah. 

A few elements of answer that:
- Man would have failed anyway (not a good explanation imo, since it means that man was vowed to fail and was given a task it couldn't fulfill. But 1 Corinthians 10:13-15 (technically, Adam and Eve were the first to be challenged, but He won't let you be tried beyond what you can bear))
- Adam could have succeeded but didn't (True, he was given the knowledge and the assignment. But when Eve gave him the fruit, the Bible makes no statement about him objecting. So he choked. Did he accept it because he is spineless, or because he wanted to follow his wife? Not clear, but if it's the latter then Adam implicitly had a choice between God and his wife and chose to follow his wife's word. He also failed to take accountability for it when asked.)

This is along with the [[1. Cosmos/The Problem of Evil\|The Problem of Evil]], one of the most intriguing problems that can be posed about the Christian God. I think that to start with, we must ask ourselves is this story meant to be taken literally? Very likely not, Jesus in the NT almost invariably explains Himself using analogies and parables, and we know that Genesis would have been written by Moses, who was obviously very far removed from any such events.

As a result, if that needed to be stated, this story is not an eye-witness testimony (shocker, I know.) So, is it an allegory of some sort? I think that yes, I don't have the theology background to back this up, but the idea that the way the story is written in the Hebrew uses formulations that would immediately recall the context-aware reader of similar stories existing in surrounding cultures that were meant to be understood as allegorical makes sense to me (this is not my idea, but I forgot where I heard it.)

If we take this full context, and the idea that God would have been the one to inspire/tell this story allegorically or otherwise, we get the idea that He for whatever reason wanted us to know about that. So somehow, someway, there is some theological point to be understood here, and the explanation that clashes with the attributes of God must be rejected, not because it is not cogent in context, but because it is only cogent in this context. The Bible being an interlinked book must be read by taking into account the full context.

Now think of the narrative the story presents.
1. God places His people somewhere nice.
2. God gives them both freedom and privation: freedom with the sole interdiction of not eating from those two trees.
3. Mankind seduced by the allure of the forbidden rationalize going against the law established by God. (Element of supernatural and outside, but mankind still is the one that chooses sin ultimately)
4. God asks them about it.
5. Mankind fails to take accountability for their act
6. God chases them from the nice place.
7. Mankind must start anew somewhere else.

This is interesting for a few reasons. The first is that this is a motif that is repeated way too often in the Bible, especially in the OT which eventually leads to the 400 years of silence during which God basically stopped sending prophets cause the Israelites were too hard-headed.

First, mankind is seduced by the idea of being like God. This is comical, because the creation narrative tells us that God had already created the humans in His image, therefore similarly to how often we look for things we don't need because we fail to be grateful for what we have, Adam and Eve yearned to be like God even though they had been set as basically ruler of a paradise able to eat whatever they wanted (but one fruit) and had been given the non-trivial role to name all living things. God had already allowed them (Adam at this point) to partake in his godhood, and it doesn't seem farfetched to imagine that as time elapsed, their collaboration would have only increased, not decreased.

The second comical thing, is the fact that the allure to differentiate Good and Evil was something that attracted them. If we think carefully, by this point Adam and Eve had already shown ability of judgement and intelligence, Adam by naming all the animals and his wife, and Eve through her conversation with the snake. So they were far from brainless. They also must have had an aesthetic sense already, since Eve describes the fruit as good to the touch and whatnot, and God doesn't overwrite the names given by Adam, considering the motif of "and it was good" shown in the creation story. While the text does not tell us that God said a similar thing here, the fact that God gave him that responsibility shows us that even at that stage, God trusted Adam's judgement/intellect to an extent. SO while the snake tried to convince Eve that God had prevented them from eating the fruit of the tree by saying God was deceiving them and didn't want them to be like Him, a cursory reading of the text shows that this can't be true; they were literally created in His image.

As I am writing this today, I think that a cogent understanding of the text is that God placed the fruits there so that eventually Adam and Eve may partake in it. They were removed from the Garden among other things to prevent them from eating the fruits of eternal life (same fruits which are described in the [[1. Cosmos/New Jerusalem\|New Jerusalem]]) seems to indicate that indeed, they were on a development path and that eventually when ready, the fruit would have been given to them. An alternative idea, that could be interesting is that the fruit of Good and Evil was always meant to be experiential, but that consuming it in due time would have lead to a tighter relationship of God and mankind on the development towards moral virtue. After all, Eve kinda already knew that disobeying to God was bad, after all without it, there would have been no need for the sake to convince her. 

Therefore, maybe "knowledge" in this context, was always meant to represent humanity experiencing what good and evil are, except that them disobeying lead to [[The Fall\|the Fall]] rather than an experiencial transformation.

This is where I lie right now on my understanding of this story.
