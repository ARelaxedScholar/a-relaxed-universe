# Yoneda Lemma

[[1. Cosmos/Functor\|Functor]]
[[1. Cosmos/Category\|Category]]
[natural transformations]
[[1. Cosmos/Set\|Set]]
[[1. Cosmos/Bijection\|bijection]]

The idea of the Yoneda Lemma is simply that based on the relations an object has you can identify, and discriminate it from another.

Say I am talking about some unnamed guy, that supposedly I know. If during the conversation, it is mentioned that this person knows someone say Sasha or Anika. The circle of possible people this guy could be reduces drastically. People are defined by their relations.

Mathematically even more so. If two objects share the exact same relations, then they can for all intent and purposes be considered the same.

## Cool Project Idea
It is vaguely related to the Yoneda Lemma but I am putting it here because my queue brought me here. 

Similarly to how you can discriminate objects based on the direct relations it has to other things eerily similar to what in [[1. Cosmos/Natural Language Processing (NLP)\|Natural Language Processing (NLP)]] to create a [[Vector Embeddings\|Vector Embeddings]] before [[Negative Sampling\|Negative Sampling]] is done to correct the relation of words like "good" and "bad" that are often to words in a similar fashion but have inverse polarity.

What if you focused on the structure and instead of directly caring about the objects that had similar relations to other elements, you looked for elements that had similar connection graphs to arbitrary elements within the embedding space. By having the same structure in their connection graph they have one of the strongest two mathematical structures can have which is the idea of [[Isomorphism\|Isomorphism]] and is it likely to structural properties discovered in one case will be relevant in the other structure groups to which it is isomorphic.

Just a thought.
