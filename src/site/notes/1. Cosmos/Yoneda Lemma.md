The idea of the Yoneda Lemma is simply that based on the relations an object has you can identify, and discriminate it from another.

Say I am talking about some unnamed guy, that supposedly I know. If during the conversation, it is mentioned that this person knows someone say Sasha or Anika. The circle of possible people this guy could be reduces drastically. People are defined by their relations.

Mathematically even more so. If two objects share the exact same relations, then they can for all intent and purposes be considered the same.
