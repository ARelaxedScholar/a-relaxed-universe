# Why I am doing Jedidiah's Records
Hola my dear lambs,

I am Jedidiah Ange-Emmanuel Kouakou, a right-brained dude that somehow ended up in STEM. Today we're here for the fifth entry of the diaries of a billionaire. Today I got a script. (Yay!)

Jokes aside, rambling in front of a camera is hard and I didn't like that prior videos didn't really make sense.

Today I want to speak about my digital garden Jedidiah's Records, why I have one, and why I think that you should as well!

Before even starting, I should probably define what a digital garden is. From my understanding, a digital garden is a way to personalize the idea of "Learning in Public." It's one of those concepts that likely many in the self-improvement sphere, that those ubermensh-in-becoming are already familiar with, but it's exactly what it sounds like. 

Learn things, and then share it with the public. You do not need to be an expert, and you don't need to be right. You just need to make the fact you're learning known and hope that people take note.

Typically this is done through some platform like Linkedin, Twitter, or even Youtube, but for all these platforms there's a certain expectation that you'll be posting "quality" content. Polished stuff. Yeah for sure you can post videos without editing them, something I'll likely be doing for a while because I do not have the time nor the energy to do that right now (ROFL) but having a digital garden explicitly bypasses that. So it's either impersonal and fake if you post on Linkedin (I do post on Linkedin, but you're forced to police your language because of the platform), not the right format to share anything serious, too much work.

The goal of a digital garden is to make the learning public, but to show to your audience the entire context, the entire ugly, messy. To give a place to the thinking that lead to a finalized note. At any given time, you can see the state of a garden. And at any given time during the lifetime of a note, it might go from raw and unfinished to a beautiful hub note.

Personally, I think that it's beautiful... poetic even.

If that's not you, maybe stick along for a bit longer, I might still be able to convince you. 

 I am not the type that writes notes for the sake of it. Most of my notes are centered around projects finished or otherwise that I tackled along my learning journeys. Some notes like those on fashion and vertical mills are notes that I took because for a long time I've had the dream of starting my very own fashion brand and I figured they'd be useful at some point, others like my math notes were experiments to see how well I learned while I took notes (turns out I don't do well) others are lyrics I wrote from listening to free music.

As I said before, I am someone with a love for the arts. To me the things interesting in mathematics being the art and satisfaction of finding a solution rather than the math itself. Similarly, to the aesthetic beauty of scrapping with concepts until everything falls into a beautiful ensemble that just makes sense, your notes going from caterpillar-seedling to beautiful butterfly-tree is carry the same aesthetic beauty. It's a microcosm of the struggle through life for beauty and self-actualization... I digress.

It is my personal belief that everyone has something they could share online, that there's one people out there that would benefit from hearing what you have to say. The catch? Most of the time, you yourself don't know what that something is.

Which is why something like a digital garden is good. By sharing your learning journeys, thoughts, etc. as they take form, you allow people that might need it full exposure to the behind the scenes. You show them what it's like to be you, to think like you, how your ideas evolved. And in that showing what it's like to be you, you show what to you might be obvious but to others might be an illumination. 

You as a scrub in a new area of life is the best person to show to other scrubs what it's like to be a scrub, but also have the best context to understand what might be difficult. But similarly, you as a goat in a certain area might be the best person to show to someone that is similar to you what it's like to succeed, how to best utilize the characteristics that make them similar to you for success.

I know that personally my superpower is that I am a passionate guy, and that passion seeps into everything I do to an extent. Even when I don't want to work on something, my pride and the fact that my name will be associated to something won't let me produce work that to me sucks. As a counterpart to that, if I do not catch myself I tend to burn out. It doesn't help that I also easily develop interest in things and end up with choice paralysis. 

Still, it's that superpower that made it so I can now say that I speak 4 languages with some amount of proficiency, I can draw, look decently good, am good at math and science, etc.

It's that unique perspective that seeps through everything I do. It's that one thing that progressive-types say that I agree with with regards to "representation". Sometimes, seeing someone like you "in the way that matters" is all you need to give yourself permission to succeed. Digital gardens I think allow you to be that someone to somebody else. 

Yes. I concur, it can feel embarrassing to have all of that in the open. The beautiful thing is that like for everything else online, you can control what exactly you share. You could do like me and post everything besides diary entries and stuff like that, or you could curate your notes and only allow what meets your standards for presentation. Because then, you have full control over your voice, and can post on your own terms.

No matter how you feel about your current state of knowledge, no matter how you feel about your current level in life, the simple fact that you are you, and lived through what you did makes you someone that at the very least is allowed at the table of "porte-paroles" as we'd say in French. You need to understand that expertise is only one way to stand out to people. And I will show that through novel character archetypes.

To start with, obviously, you could be an expert. The type of person so good at what they do that people begrudginly watch you despite your sucky personality and ponder your every words. If you're a dude, and you're handsome, doubly so. The way I worded that was weird, you don't need to be an asshole to be an expert, in fact if you are a nice and understanding expert say JBStatistics or Statquest, people will love you all the more for it. The idea was 

Authenticity is another one, being unapologetically you and showing yourself on the journey to become the best version of you is one way to attract the gaze despite people knowing you are not perfect, you become something that people can stand behind. Because in some way or another they see themselves in you. You won't be everyone's cup of tea, and that's perfect, you shouldn't try to be. But for those that jive with you, you'll be the best.

You could do content that erases you. Say animation, or writing, or any content of that kind. People rally not around you perse, but around your works. Think of those stories where there's no discernible main character, or if there is, he's really just a vehicle through which people can experiment the story.

You could push the envelope further and do wish-fulfilment content. You have already succeeded, you don't have much to say necessarily, or much areas in which you feel like an expert. But you know that you got the means to show off and represent the dream to people. That's another avenue for success online, and you can likely think of many youtubers on the platform doing exactly that.

You can talk with any persona you wish, and you can combine any of those archetypes to make a character that pleases you and your audience.
