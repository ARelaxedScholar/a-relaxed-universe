# Tony Stark is a Vibe-Coder?
I was just chilling one Sunday afternoon, when my comic-illiterate ass realized that Tony Stark—my kinda idol—was a vibe coder.

For the longest time, I yearned to be the creator of the world's first Jarvis, but while I wanted to bring the world AI, be lauded as the genius, billionaire, ~~playboy~~, philanthropist myself, I was also a 11 year-old kid with no tech skill and no idea how to get there. I was a computer-litterate art kid. I had a clear idea that programming would be important, but that was about it.

Jump 10 years in the future, and after learning the likes of Lua (for Roblox) and Python in my teens, internalizing that creating something of Jarvis' magnitude is more or less impossible, and dabbling in anything that vaguely sounded techy (I'm on Arch btw), we now have Jarvis. Actually, no we still don't. It's such a missed opportunity, but I digress.

While, young me simply lacked the compute to ever achieve it—only partly cope—this thought made me laugh. Tony Stark is a vibe-coder. He's undeniably a genius, an engineer, a mad man and everything else we love about him, but when we look at the way he's depicted (at least in the movies), he was a macro-thinker, clear ideas, amazing tinkering abilities, and the ability to delegate when it matters—usually to his superintelligent (conscious?) AI.

In a similar fashion, I've recently started accustoming myself to the idea of transitioning to vibe-coding myself. I love programming, and I love learning and upskilling on the necessary skills to get good at software engineering and computer science, and just being my own brand of ubermensch. I also like cars and looking into mastering 3D modeling and macgyvering things.

So, being a "coder" has never really been part of my identity, and I had fallen into the trap of letting it infiltrate my identity as I worried about AI replacing me. There's still many things AI doesn't do well, and those things, I'll code with pleasure. Still Gemini, GPT and Claude are absolutely fantastic for templating and getting you over that initial blank page hitch and I think I'll stop resisting the wave of change. I still want to understand "my" code, therefore I make a point to read the generated code, debug it and re-implement what doesn't work. I will also just manually code things as a learning example when I want to learn a technology.

Still more than a "coder", I am a "programmer", or rather a "creator".

AI will never take that away from me.
