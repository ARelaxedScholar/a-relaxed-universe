# Use Nature to Find Ideas

God used fundamental principals and rules to construct the world we live in currently.

In Christianity there's a concept of [[2 Words\|2 Words]], one that is the literal word that we call the Bible and the other is the wor(l)d all around us. 

This note is concerned with the later. If we take the time to posit about the beauty of the world around us, we quickly realize that a lot things and solutions to problems lie in simply observing and replicating nature.

For example, earlier I was talking with Garrett a friend from the university, who talked about how he had been working on  a system to make Roombas not get stuck in the corners, and did so using [[Genetic Algorithms \|Genetic Algorithms ]]. 

He had gotten the idea that motivated his design from cockroaches and remarking that they do not get stuck in corners even though they only have two sensors (I didn't verify that claim, but I'mma take his word for it.) 

He gave another problem about the [[Traveling Salesman \|Traveling Salesman ]] problem where he explained to that one of the best solutions involved replicating nature once again. This time using their pheromones.

The world has a lot of knowledge to offer us, if we only stop to look at it.
