# Normal Maps

They are a way to add detailed geometry visually, without actually adding more polygons to the mesh.
A good example is the following render which has jagged epaulets and armor (low poly mesh) with highly detailed looking curves and engravings.

VS what the mesh probably looks like.

A pretty common workflow for normal maps is to create a high poly model of a given model, export the normal map from the software, and then using it on a low poly model.
