# The Sixth Church ~ Philadelphia

Nothing bad is mentioned and in fact, Jesus says that to reward them for holding strong despite their weakness, he will make followers of Satan (who call themselves Jews) come to them and bow.
They are told to hold firm so that none can ravish their crown.

Is the city of Philadelphia named after them?
