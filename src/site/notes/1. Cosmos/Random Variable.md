# Random Variable

In the formal mathematical language of [measure theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory "Measure theory"), a random variable is defined as a [measurable function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function "Measurable function") from a [probability measure space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_measure_space "Probability measure space") (called the _sample space_) to a [measurable space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_space "Measurable space").

This is ripped directly out of Wikipedia. It seems the meaning is that it represents a variable whose value is the outcome of some random (uncontrolled) event. If I fix the event, then the thing is no longer a random variable. A random variable has by definition a probability associated to it, a probability connected to how many elements in the [[Sample Space\|Sample Space]] imply occurence of this random variable.
