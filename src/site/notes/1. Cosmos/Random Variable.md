# Random Variable
In the formal mathematical language of [measure theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory "Measure theory"), a random variable is defined as a [measurable function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function "Measurable function") from a [probability measure space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_measure_space "Probability measure space") (called the _sample space_) to a [measurable space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_space "Measurable space").

Indeed a random variable is a [[1. Cosmos/Measurable Maps\|measure map]] of one dimension where the space being mapped to is the real line $\mathbb R$.
