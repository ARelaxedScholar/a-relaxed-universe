# Types of Joins
![Pasted image 20240528113057.png](/img/user/3.%20Black%20Holes/Files/Pasted%20image%2020240528113057.png)
Left Join: We want all the elements on the left whether or not they are connected to anything on the right, but only want elements on the right if they are connected to something on the left.

Right Join: The exact opposite of Left Join

Inner Join: We only want elements which are paired. It's the intersection of two tables.

Full Join: Does not exist in some RDMS (like MySQL) but essentially we just have a big table that combines everything irrespective of whether there are connections.
