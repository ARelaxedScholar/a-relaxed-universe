# New Ideas for Language Learning

Cue : I was in a state between awake and asleep and I was writing a note for something else, I had this idea.

Context : On 29th, I woke up because of a mix between a tummy ache and having a nice idea that I had to jot down. After writing it on Obsidian mobile, I had this idea.

Content : 
Well, Rob Macphearson or whoever is the dude on youtube who suggested the transcription learning method can be partly attributed with this idea even though it's totally different from what he intented.

The intensive Parent Listening method
1. Find a Parent in your Target Language (ie: Nakata University)
2. Find a video of them you're quite interested about and put it on repeat.
3. If there are transcripts, get them, if there aren't and you got a lot of time write them (really high yield exercise) and get a native to look over it, else get Whisper to write a transcript for you (what I'd do).
4. Tear the shit out of the transcript, grammar, vocab, cultural references, everything that doesn't make sense, look up until either a) tired of looking, b) it makes sense now.
5. (In parallel) You'll probably spread the grammar breakdown over multiple days so during those days just listen to the chosen parent video on repeat.
6. Once done with the process, add video to your listening content bank.
7. Test yourself by watching the video one last time.

### Purported Benefits
- Increase your familiarity with your parent in such a way that they become easier to understand.
- High repetition and multiple passes gives your brain a chance to catch words you know, but for whatever reason didn't catch. corollary: Each listening is going to make the words you don't know i+1 (or closer to it).
- Related to last, but context awareness so high it'll make you puke.
- Multiple modalities (audiovisual, audio, text) will reinforce the vocab, patterns and new info you learn.

### How to apply technique?
I don't see why both techniques wouldn't be usable even by a beginner, since the high repetition, presence of a transcript, and just sheer time spent on the task will spend as an equalizer in the long end.
1. (Hardcore) : Find your Parent, and do that for all their videos.
You'll likely get all the benefits I mentioned above, but I don't know how fun it will be. I'd bet you'd learn a lot relatively quickly tho.
2. (Recommended) : Find a subset of videos of the parent that seems to cover the breadth of vocab they are likely to use (easier to do if it's a youtube tailored to a niche), and then use the technique outlined above to embed the relevant terminology, vocab and more importantly the way to talk about that field in your brain. Then once you're done doing that, regular listening should be much easier since doing the exercise on a subset of videos should have exposed you both to **their** core vocab, and to **field-specific** vocab.
