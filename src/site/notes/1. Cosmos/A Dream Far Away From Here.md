# A Dream Far Away From Here

## Story
Lux wake up in his bed, ready to go tend to his garden and do tasks for his community. His entire life he has been told that no matter what happens he should never go beyond the clairriere, that only death awaits him there.

Lux is a curious boy therefore he has tried many times to do so, but every time his parents catch him, and he is severely reprimanded for his lack of care.

The weird thing is that like clockwork every first of the month, people come into town from the direction of the clairriere to deliver food and other goods, and then leave. He tried to sneak away with them, but somehow, always he gets caught.

One day, for some conspicuous reason, Lux wakes up and doesn't see his parents.—he doesn't know it but there has been a bug in the system that maintained his simulation and the village has disappeared—he is able to reach the clairriere and as he gets there there's a choice:

First Choice: Get back home -> 
- Either he gets back home (First Ending: He Who Slumbers)
- Or he steps through the clairriere (What should happen for the story to continue)

Then from there it's a series of procedurally generated levels with a team, NPCs, and a mission. Escape from the dream (he doesn't know he's in a dream.)

As he starts wandering through the clairriere the world seems to become more and more mishapely as he progresses, a voice as if from deity thunders and calmly tells him to turn way. Kindly as if coaxing him, you are looking for your parents, they are back home. Lux is not exactly puzzled by the voice and in fact thinks that it's the god that he's been hearing about so much and is super excited! But being Lux he refuses to go home.

As things progresses the god becomes more and more keen on sending him back home, with NPCs and stuff trained through RL to ensure they start adapting to the players choice and becoming tougher and tougher for him.

## Game Loops

1. Player is in room
2. Player has ability to move and grow a map
3. Enemies appear on the map and become more and more aggressive as player progresses
4. Collision with a monster on the world map results in fight
5. Turn based fighting
6. Loss results in permadeath.


## MVP
1. Map created
2. Ability to walk 
3. Ability to fight with monsters
4. Way to complete current stage

## Stretch Goals
1. RL system for adaptability of monsters
2. Generate dungeons using grammatical evolution of graphs
3. All items are mystery by default with boosted effects (bonuses and maluses) (say 25-50%) if they are used in their imaginary form, and clear understanding of what they are but return to reality if used in their concrete form (player meets a helper NPC that helps them unlock this ability and explain them the effect.)
