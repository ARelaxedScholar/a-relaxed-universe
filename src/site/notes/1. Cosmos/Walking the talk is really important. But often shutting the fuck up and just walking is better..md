# Walking the talk is really important. But often shutting the fuck up and just walking is better.

I don't remember why exactly I jotted that down, but I think this is an issue that plagues people. Too many people know about their projects before they ever have the time to do anything serious.

I think this is another manifestation of the goldfish attention span of people in my generation. How many people get off on the idea of respect and admiration that others often unrelated people will give them as opposed  to the dopamine of actually succeeding. It's kind of like getting a knock-off Rolex because the real thing is too expensive.

Fair, in certain contexts it might make sense. Maybe you do not care about the Rolex itself and your goal is just to get social appeal from strangers. If that's you, keep doing that. Maybe you just want to like you're doing something among peers of people that actually do something.

But if your goal is to become someone that younger you could be proud of, if your goal is to eventually be the kind of person that can live on their own terms and retire your parents for example, you need to learn that whatever dopamine that you get from telling people your projects is at best a motivator, and at worse complete trash which will rob you from accomplishing your project.

If you want to do something, but you already reaped the social proof of doing it because your friends already rewarded you, then what are the odds you will actually work on the project. You will probably start it, but will you complete it? I'd imagine that no, because coding projects are hard and unless the project you are working on is actually something you are genuinely interested in or something for which there's an external driving force that forces you to do things you will not complete the work for which you already reaped social proof.

This is only point 1, there's also the fact that telling people will blur your vision. Sometimes you have an idea that makes sense, an idea that you think could genuinely be groundbreaking, but then you lose sight of how great the idea is because you need to explain why and how to people who don't understand it.

Sometimes that is proof that your idea sucks, so at some point you should still get some feedback from others, but at the same time that sort of feedback should only come from friends if you already know that your friends are your target audience because else, what are you doing asking to dogs what's the favorite food of cats?

You should let research and ideation be the driving forces for your creation of projects and potentially business, not your friends, because unless your friends are your target audience, their opinion doesn't really matter.

A follow-up?
