# The Seventh Church ~ Laodicea

The "useless" church? The "not hold, not cold" church.

I call them useless as according to an interpretation I heard, in the region surrounding Laodicea there are hot springs and cold something else. As a result, the hot springs were used as a spot of relaxation and whatnot, and the cold was used for therapeutic reasons.

As a result, here Jesus is not saying, He wished they were cold so that He could cleanly cut them away as some interpretations say, which make Jesus sound eager to punish.

But rather, He is saying that like water that is neither hot nor cold, I can't use you to brew delightful tea, I can't use you to create a refreshing beverage. At most you are good for helping me throw up (actual method btw) which is funny as that is the same language used in the Bible.

They are a big and powerful church with a lot of money, but similarly to how many lose sight of God and those that gave them their success when they reach success, they have lost sight of Jesus.
So Jesus is telling them to remember Him, to turn their eyes towards Him, and to come to Him for their riches.

Those who He loves, He corrects.
