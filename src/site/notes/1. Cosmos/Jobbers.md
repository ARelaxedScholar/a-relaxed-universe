They buy the rejected products from millls, and make sure that they are sold instead of being placed in landfills.

The advantage is that it allows for indie artists to get fabrics for cheap. However since they buy rejected fabrics, there is no guarantee that you'll be able to buy in a repeated fashion. Their business model implies that what you see this year, will almost certainly not be what you see next year.

They're kinda like [[1. Cosmos/Distributers\|Distributers]] but for rejected fabrics.
