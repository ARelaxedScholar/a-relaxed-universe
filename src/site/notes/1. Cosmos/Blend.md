# Blend
A blend is as it says, a mix of fibers. It typically combines a filament fiber with a staple fiber, where the filament fiber will be used as the skeleton or the base, and the staple fiber will be "stapled"  to the ensemble.

Thus made, the blend will have both the strength of the man-made material, with the perks of whatever stable was used (breathability, softness, heat-retention, etc.)
