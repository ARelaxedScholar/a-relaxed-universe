# Staple Fibers

Are short fibers, cotton is a good example of stable fiber. Anything from really short to a few inches (let's say 4 inches). While we noted cotton, it doesn't have to be natural, man-made stable fibers exist as well.

They have to be amassed, combed, and then twisted to obtain yarns.
