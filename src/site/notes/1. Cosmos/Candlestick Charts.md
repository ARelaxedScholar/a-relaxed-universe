# Candlestick Charts
A supremely important type of chart for trading. Functionally, this is the one thing that pretty much all traders use to analyze the market. It is a chart made of candlesticks.

Each candlestick holds the following information:
- Opening Price
- Closing Price
- Highest Price
- Lowest Price

The give a lot of information and truly are one of the keys to trade.

Like anything else they need to be taken in context. While alone they can give us information, it is typically when we cluster them that it is interesting to use as we can see patterns. Trading is all about pattern recognition.
