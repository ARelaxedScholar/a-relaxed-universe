# The Problem of Evil

It's a common problem which leads many believers to abandon faith.
In fact one could argue it is THE problem that is posed to people that believe in God, as usually everything else can be explained or at least justified through proper understanding of history.

It's usually phrased somewhat like that.
"We say God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, we also claim that God is all-good and virtuous. Hence if that's the case why does he allow such unfair evil in this world, kids dying from starvation, earthquakes, etc:
- Either he wants to stop them, but can't stop them. So he is not all-powerful and if that's true, then is He even worthy of worship? Even arguing He is, can we trust the Bible that claims He's something He's not?
- Maybe He can stop it, but just doesn't. Then can we really say He's good? It seems obvious that any of us, given the ability to stop evil would do so... so which is it?"

While the case I presented above is likely an oversimplification limited by my own current understanding of things, the answer is neither. There's a third option. The problem of evil is a false dichotomy in the first place, we can have a God that is both perfectly good and omnipotent while having him allow evil.

Simply by claiming that for whatever reason that evil is necessary or serves some greater purpose that we can't understand.  I won't go too much in-depth, but there's a plethora of reasons that can explain the problem of evil from evil being necessary, to free-will implying having to deal with the consequences of our own choice. I can say that this is surely an unsatisfying answer even to me as I write it, but that is a natural consequence of the attributes we claim God has. If it is that God is omniscient, then it is necessary that for Him to know things that we don't and comprehend things that we cannot. You wouldn't expect a dog, or even a toddler to comprehend the plans you have to run your life. Yet God, we are infinitely closer to the intelligence of a rock than we are to the intelligence and knowledge that God has, as a result it is conceited for us to assume that everything He does could make sense to us.
