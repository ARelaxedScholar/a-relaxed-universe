# The Problem of Evil

It's a common problem which leads many believers to abandon faith.
It's usually phrased somewhat like that.
"We say God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, we also claim that God is all-good and virtuous. Hence if that's the case why does he allow such unfair evil in this world, kids dying from starvation, earthquakes, etc:
- Either he wants to stop them, but can't stop them. So he is not all-powerful and if that's true, then is He even worthy of worship, even arguing he is, can we trust the Bible that claims he's something he's not.
- Maybe he can stop it, but just don't. Then can we really say he's good? It seems obvious that any of us, given the ability to stop evil would do so... so which is it?"

While the case I presented above is likely an oversimplification limited by my own current understanding of things, the answer is neither. There's a third option. The problem of evil is a false dichotomy in the first place, we can have a God that is both perfectly good and omnipotent while having him allow evil.

Simply by claiming that for whatever reason that evil is necessary.  I won't go too much in-depth, but there's a plethora of reasons that can explain the problem of evil from evil being necessary, to free-will implying having to deal with the consequences of our own choice.
