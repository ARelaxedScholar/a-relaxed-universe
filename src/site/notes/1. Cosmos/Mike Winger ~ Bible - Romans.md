## Why Christian Extremism Is Good?
Really quickly. He basically says that Christian extremism is good because someone who is a Christian to the extreme, will know better than to do *insert bad thing*.

While the term "extremism" is loaded by default, because of its association with other groups, and what we typically observe of those extremists. Still he makes the case that while, in many of those other groups those bad things are an expected action of those that follow their sources as they were intended, in Christianity a proper reading of the text will lead the Christian to be serving to the extreme, loving to the extreme, truth-teller to the extreme (which combined with the latter point would imply having tact), etc. 

Which is an interesting view.
He covers a few things, but the ones that resonated with me the most was the calling to sanctification (which is why it's filled.) I am creating the others to fill in on other occasions.
