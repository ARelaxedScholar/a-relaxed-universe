# Quads

They are a pretty fundamental part of computer graphics, and are basically squares. In computer graphics since everything is a triangle, a quad is basically a square/triangle/quadrilateral build using two triangles. 

They are convenient since they can be used to add textures to a game. Take a given texture/image whatever -> put it on a transparent background -> Use two triangles to build the thing in a game, [[1. Cosmos/Element Buffer Objects (EBO)\|EBOs]] would likely be relevant here since these two triangles would represent one object.
