# Bernoulli Distribution
The mother of all [[Probability Distributions\|Probability Distributions]], because every other distribution can be turned into that if we want to.

## Properties
Take $n$ $i.i.d$ distributed Bernoulli trials, the moment generating function for the entire set of trials (let's call it $Y$) will be given by :
$$
E(e^{tY})=M(t)=\sum+{k=0}^n nCk~ p^k q^{n-k} e^{tk}
$$
