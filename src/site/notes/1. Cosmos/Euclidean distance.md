# Euclidean distance
This is the basic and most natural measure of distance, also called the $L_2-norm$.
It measures distance in terms of Pythagorean theorem and straight lines through space.

I don't know what much to say here because if you've ever walked anywhere in a straight line and cut a line to walk diagonally, you made use of the Euclidean distance.

As a norm it respects the triangular inequality $||a||_2 + ||b||_2 \ge ||a+b||_2$ and is always positive.
