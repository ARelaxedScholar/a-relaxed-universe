# Day 3 ~ Probably Leave PDF aside for now
### First Session
Well, I have some reading. Enough reading to make me realizing that to start with, I probably do not want to work with PDFs. EPUBs are great, and while most of the stuff that is relevant to me is in PDF, I will try to sidestep the issue by using Epub, markdown and potentially XPS. 

At the time, I didn't know that PDF was such a mess of a format.

So I officially started coding, I looked at Calibre's code, more specifically their annotator.py to have an idea of how I could implement the annotations. I thought of saving the annotations directly to HTML in the epub, but then this came with the problem of modifying the files directly which might not be ideal.

Didn't do to much, still finding my footing around Tauri. But eh, slowly but surely.

## Second Session
I was tired so I went to catch a nap, before I knew it it was time for Bible study at church, so when I came back to the project after slacking off (started a webtoon called 'El Joven Mimado') and eating.

I cleaned my space and returned for a second session. I am not expecting it to be for too long, but was raring for doing things. 

This session will be dedicated to just ironing out the external highlight system. Indeed as i had already decided in the first session, I will not be modifying the epubs directly. While this come with loss of portability since the notes and highlights will only be available in my app, if I make Uriel my main reading app, it shouldn't be an issue.

There's also the fact that keeping the epub unchanged for whatever reason the end-user might have, and the freedom obtained by being able to establish my own system to deal with the highlights are good advantages to have.

In this session I mostly just thought about the external structure more, added the stuff I need and started leaving TODO crumbs that I will fill as time allows.
