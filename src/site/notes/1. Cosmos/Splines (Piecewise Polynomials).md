# Splines (Piecewise Polynomials)

A type of model used in [[1. Cosmos/Machine Learning\|Machine Learning]] where we augment the data with information about the region in which the model lies through the indicator function basis.

We then fit a model that best makes use of this new information to split polynomials to
