# Do the Fathers Not talk to their Son About God
**Bible Reference:** 2 Chronicles 28

**Context:** Achaz is a king that followed Jotham and was his son. While Jotham didn't live that long (died at 41 if I am not wrong), he had a son who totally went against everything he stood for. Building altars to other gods, sacrificing his sons to them, and even taking the riches of the temple of god to give them to those gods and to build new temples for those ones.

**Content:** Did Jotham not speak to his son? How is it that there are so many cases of terrible king that lead their people astray after good kings. I'd take a gander that either it's because they don't live long and thus don't have time to leave an impression on their kid, or it's because they don't communicate much with them. But even if that's true, wouldn't you expect that they would have Bible teachers or something to make sure they know the law of God? Do they just not care?

I see from this passage that it's crucial to tell your children about God, do not take for granted that them seeing you act is enough. If they don't walk with God even though you did walk with God, while there won't necessarily be consequences for you (if you did raise them in God's ways and correct them), it still reflects poorly on you. Moreover, you want to be able to be with them in heaven.
