# Eigenspace
The set/space that contains all the [[1. Cosmos/Eigenvector\|eigenvectors]] for a eigenvalue $\lambda$.
It is also referred to as $\lambda$-eigenspace, but when which eigenvalue is implied is clear, the lambda is often dropped.

The eigenspace is just the [[Null Space\|null space]] of this matrix $A-\lambda I_n$.
*Note: Since an Eigenspace is always a subspace of $R^{n}$, the 0 vector is always in it.*
## Relevant theorem


You can't quite call a dot a space right? For something to be a **space** you need a concept of dimension. The ker(B) being equal to {0} essentially implies that the space doesn't exist, after all if your world can be spanned by nothingness, then it's not much of a world, is it?
