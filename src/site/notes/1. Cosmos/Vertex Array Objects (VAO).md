# Vertex Array Objects (VAO)

An object in which we store information about a 3D/2D objects. A VAO contains up to 16 attributes of a 3D/2D object from the position of said object, to its texture. Each VAO's attributes will be populated by a [[1. Cosmos/Vertex Buffer Object (VBO)\|Vertex Buffer Object (VBO)]] as it would be too painful to plug everything by hand.

## How do we access?
Each VAO has an ID, by which it can be referred (and thus accessed).
