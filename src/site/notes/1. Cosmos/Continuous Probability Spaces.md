# Continuous Probability Spaces
Continuous Probability Spaces are to [[1. Cosmos/Borel-Sigma Algebras\|Borel-Sigma Algebras]] what [[1. Cosmos/Discrete Probability Spaces\|Discrete Probability Spaces]] are to $2^\varOmega$.

Make sure you have a good understanding of Borel$-\sigma-$algebras before proceeding.

In continuous probability spaces, our [[1. Cosmos/Measurable Space\|Measurable Space]] is by default $(\varOmega, \mathscr B(\varOmega))$ which we typically just write $(\varOmega, \mathscr B)$.

In general we choose our $\varOmega$ to be $(0,1]$ where we expressly exclude $0$ and include $1$, while this might look arbitrary we do so for two reason:
- Any results we can derive for this interval can be generalized for sample spaces $(0,1), [0,1], [0,1)$
- It makes some upper level derivations easier and we avoid issues like $log(0)$ and whatnot.

## Defining the [[Uniform Distribution\|Uniform Distribution]]
We want two things to do that:
- We want our measure of the probability to be proportional to the length of the interval under consideration
- We want our measure of the probability to be invariant under translation, any arbitrary of length $\alpha$ (where $\alpha=|b-a|$) should have the same [[1. Cosmos/Probability Measure\|Probability Measure]] no matter where they are.
