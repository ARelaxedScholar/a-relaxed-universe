# To Those With Too Many Passions
Hello my dear lambs,

I am Ange-Emmanuel Kouakou and today I wanted to talk to all the right-brained artistic people with too many passions and too many ideas.

Yeah...

If you're anything like me, there are MANY things at which you want to become proficient, and many different fields you want to excel in, leave your trace, and for whatever reason you are in a hurry. It all needs to happen now, right now, tomorrow.

And because there's so much to do, and you can't do it all one of three things happen:
- You try to do it all, stagnating and being mediocre at many things, sticking to it simply because admitting you were wrong would "hurt" more than just stopping and recalibrating
- You can't do it all, and thus do nothing at all, instead procrastinating and finding excuse for your inaction.
- Or you have a lightning of genius, I can't do everything at once. But you're not smitten strongly enough and lack focus, cycling your passions n two short a time-frame, in the end achieving nothing of substance. Starving your progress on any one thing by lack of focus.

Whichever one you end up doing is less than optimal. I won't waste your time any longer. If you're watching this, you already know the problem you have. You want to learn languages, psychology, quantum mechanics, how to play the guitar, and produce and are getting nowhere.

First thing first, you are not broken. This curiosity is a super power, and if you actually stop and be objective about it, and where you are right now. While the progress was not optimal, claiming that it was useless is overstated. You accomplished things. You got some level of proficiency. And if nothing else, by trying your end at multiple things, or at least considering them you have a more panoramic view of any given issue, and of learning skills as opposed to someone who specialized.

Still, you need focus. This is a message as much to you as to me. 
I actively need to routinely assess how I have been dealing my time, and tell myself no, in fact if I fail to do so on like a seasonal basis at the bare minimum, I tend to lose my edge and start spraying. Too many different things, too many different objectives..

The FOCUS method is exceedingly simple:
1. Take a sheet of paper, in my case I like to do it in Obsidian so that I have a record of it down the line.
2. List all the passions you have at the moment, all the things you want to become good at, all the things that are important spiritually, everything that you think needs that are already in your life that you cannot cut out. Jot it all down, underline the things you can't take away (study time), etc to differentiate them from the optional stuff.
3. For each optional thing, ask yourself:
   - Why do you want to pursue this thing?
   - What do you hope to achieve by pursuing it?
   - Is it potentially synergizable with something else on the list, if so what?
   - Realistically, how long would it take to learn that skill
4. After you are done ranking the skills, you will select two synergizable things to work on, or one if that one thing is already enough on its own. Not more. Why at most 2. 
Because realistically this is the most you can reasonably do. If you are a student, or you are working, or you got kids, you do not have the time to effectively pursue many things at once in lew of your main thing. Which should be your work/family/student career. If we say that to reach a good level of proficiency in a skill you will need something like 1h of daily practice minimum (unless it's a skill that can be learned in an afternoon in which case go off), then when we include time to eat, work, study, spend time with family and friends, 2 hours daily is something that reasonably most people can get in their day. (Just stop using your phone)

More skills than that, and it is unlikely that you stick for it long enough to start reaping the benefits.

You feel lied to? The goal is to become a polymath, no? What will I do with two skills. Well you'll stick to it for 3 months. During those three months you will practice that skill daily. In three months depending on the skill, you can go from beginner to advanced beginner (which is already better than most people) and start doing stuff with that skill. At which point you reassess, do you want to keep raising the stats of those skills? Then you keep the selection the same and forget other skills, else if during those three months you realized that actually you do not like that skill that much you can drop it then.

If you're like me, you are young. While with the impending AI apocalypse it's easy to become worried, and it's a fact that we're living through times never seen in human history, it is also a fact that even with desperation, you will not be able to reach high level of proficiency in different fields by doing everything haphazardly. You have time time to learn those skills, and even if you think you don't, act as if you do. The more leisurely and relaxed you are as you learn, the better the knowledge stick.

This is my first video as The Relaxed Scholar, if this was helpful leave a like and a comment, and tell me what I should improve.

God bless.
