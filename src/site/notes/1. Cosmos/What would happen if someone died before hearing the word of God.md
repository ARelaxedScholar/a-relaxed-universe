# What would happen if someone died before hearing the word of God

This is a question often asked to christian in order to trial the justice of God, and make christians stumble since in general rule. They themselves don't know.

But John 15:22 gives us a clear answer.

> [!Bible]-
> 22. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin,  but now they have no excuse for their sin.
> 
  [John 15:22 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/43/15/)


Which pretty much answers the question in one fell swoop. If someone has never heard of God, or is not mentally able to comprehend the word of God, then it follows (can be inferred) from this verse that they are sinless. Not as humans, but simply by the fact that they don't have the capacity to know what they do is wrong, and that 
\'they ought to do something else.
