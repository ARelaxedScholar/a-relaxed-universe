# The Calling To Sanctification
For context, I am writing this as a reaction to Mike Winger's comments on sanctification in his video [[1. Cosmos/Mike Winger ~ Bible - Romans#Why Christian Extremism Is Good?\|"Why Christian Extremism is Good"]].

First, Mike Winger makes a difference between the concept of calling as what you are to **BE** versus what you are to **DO**.

Indeed all throughout our lives as Christians we hear the idea of "calling", and some simply see it as "the dream" that they have, but more fundamentally it is supposed to be what you are to do for God.

The issue is that, a calling the doing say "prophesy", "teaching", etc. is something in which you can only flourish, and that (most of the time) will only be made clear to you once you **are** in a given state. Indeed it is one thing to call oneself Christian, but as Jordan Peterson says, it is a whole other to actually carry your cross and take the full commitment that is embedded in that idea. Among other things, [[Sanctification\|sanctification]]. You have to set yourself apart, and to make yourself pure. Yes, sure God is merciful and loves you regardless of what you do--but do you love Him? I am writing so much on something he said in the first few minutes because this resonates a lot with me. A lot of the time, and this is natural to some extent, we *love* ourselves more than we love God.

God says if you love me, then uphold my commandments. But quite often, because it is inconvenient, because it is something we want to do (our flesh wants to do), we choose the easy option instead of what's good. In a sense, every time we show by our actions that we love/prioritize whatever we chose to defend/select/do more than the Creator.

You will not flourish in your calling before you've sanctified yourself, and that sanctification is not according to your own desires, own interpretations, own prejudices, but according to the Word. As I am writing this, I know that recently there's many things I have been doing where I actively undermined my calling to sanctification. Which is not **MY** calling by the way, it's a calling to all Christians. 

Yet again, God is merciful and loving; but the modern lie that we are perfect and just as we are is backwards and is simply not compatible with Christianity. Your flesh is what pulls you to sin, and you need to know that whatever place you are at right now, God has a higher vision for you.
