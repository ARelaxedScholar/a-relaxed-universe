# Hom Functor

Say there are two objects in a category, then their exist a hom-set which contains all the possible morphisms between them.

The relation that connects them is the [[1. Cosmos/Hom Functor\|Hom Functor]].

hom(-,c ) : means hom functor from outside to c
hom(c, -) : means hom functor from c to outside.



Say c, and a are isomorphic (the same) iff hom(-,c) is hom(-,a).
