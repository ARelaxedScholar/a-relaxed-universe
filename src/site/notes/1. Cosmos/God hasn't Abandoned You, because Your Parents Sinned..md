# God hasn't Abandoned You, because Your Parents Sinned.
**Bible Reference:** 2 Chronicles 27

**Context:** Jotham is the son of a king who died in shame as a leper, and who was forced to have his son serve as a regeant of sorts, since he were to be out of the throne room. His father [[1. Cosmos/Know your place\|Ozias]] was a man who walked in front of God but then profaned his temple by burning encenses despite not having the function to do so.

**Thought:** Despite the shameful act and death, Jotham lived and was strengthened in front of the Lord because he walked steadfastly in front of him. He didn't reign as long as other kinds (merely 16 years) and the text seems to suggest he didn't live too long either (became king at 25 and reigned 16 implying he likely died at 41.) While he lived he weas still strong and powerful thanks to the Lord.
