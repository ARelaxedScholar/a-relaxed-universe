# Hypertext Protocol (HTTP)
This is one of the protocol which powers the web as we know it.

It has an overachieving brother called [[Hypertext Protocol Secure (HTTPS)\|Hypertext Protocol Secure (HTTPS)]] which combines [[Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\|Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)]] and [[Transport Layer Security (TLS)\|Transport Layer Security (TLS)]] to do encryption and decryption. It is a must of today's web and especially crucial for sensitive operations like banking, but it can be slowert due to the encrypting and decrypting that must take place.
