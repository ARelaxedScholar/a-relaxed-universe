# All It Takes is One Good Leader.

**Bible Reference** :  2 Chronicles 29

**Context (Optional)** : Was reading the verse and saw of Ezechias was a good follower of God.

**Content** : The leader is the one that decides where the boat goes. A leader can have the best team, if he himself is incompetent he will spoil their abilities and the boat will capsize. Ezechias was lead by a lot of unworthy leaders who despite the great miracles of God turned to other divinities and desacrated the temples of God. Some even offered their sons as sacrifices to those other gods, an abomination even Abraham wasn't allowed to commit. After all, while God enjoys such zealous faith, the children he gives you are not to be burned by the fire as offering.

This leader Ezechias, brought the Levites back to their functions and urged them to repair the temple. Sincerely yearned for an alliance with the true God. Then lead the people in front of God  with rejoice and worship. This is crucial since without it, Israel and Juda would have remained in that state of forlogness they were in. Each time one leader is all it takes for the people to either descend to madness or return to God with their hearts. 

The heart of man is crooked and weak, but a strong leader knows where to lead the sheep.
