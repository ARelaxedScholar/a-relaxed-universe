# Fabrics
Silk is not a fabric it's a fiber.

There are two types of fabrics; man-made & natural.
The natural is made from natural fibers like wool, silk, leather, etc.

And the man-made is made from man-made fibers, nylon fabric, acrilic fabric, gore-tex.

A fabric has a [[1. Cosmos/Cross-Grain\|Cross-Grain]] and a [[1. Cosmos/Straight-Grain\|Straight-Grain]], most fabrics have a front and a back. The assumption will be to use the front of whatever fabric you're using, so if it wanna go against the grain. You better make sure.

A fabric also has [[1. Cosmos/Selvedge\|Selvedge]].

4 types of fabrics:
- [[Woven\|Woven]]

the mains ones are

When going to a sales rep, you want to specify everything. The wait, how it should looks, the materials, etc.  You want to help your rep, help you. Do not be cheap on details and do not leave the work to your sales rep to read your mind, they won't want to work with you.
