# Bijection

This is a concept that works the same in [[1. Cosmos/Function\|function]], set, and likely group theory as well. But it is easier to understand with sets.

Take two sets A and B.
The function that maps elements from A to B (or vice-versa) is a bijection, if each element of A is mapped to exactly one element of B AND if all elements in B is mapped to at most 1 element in A.

In layman's term : A bijection is a one-to-one mapping from elements of A to elements of B.
