# Axiom Of Choice
It states that:
A Cartesian product of nonempty sets is nonempty.
In other words, given a (possibly infinite) collection of nonempty sets, we can make a selection from each of the sets.

It's a technique that is used [[Set Theory\|Set Theory]] to in a sense put the onus on the reader to prove something. It allows me to state that things with some properties exist without me having to prove that they do exist.
