# Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
The programming language by excellence! Lol.
This is what we call a markup language like Markdown, which is concerned about putting the semantics of document in language. Unlike Markdown, it's ugly ash.

Still, it is one of the foundations of the internet as we know it, and is what allows a programmer to define the structure and content of a webpage. 

If HTML is the "fond", then [[Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\|Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)]] is the "forme", taking care of making everything nice and pretty.

While great tools, it can still be kind of a pain to get things to look consistent across browsers. This is less of a problem now with every browser being "Chromium"-based, and I don't see it going any other way cause any browser that comes after that would have to compete against the browser and the extensive library of add-ons they come with, but yeah.
