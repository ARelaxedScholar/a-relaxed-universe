# The Third Church ~ Pergamum

Jesus is actually proud of them as despite being in the middle of enemy territory, they remain strong and steadfast in the fate.

Still their fault is double:
- They follow the doctrine of Balaam (the dude from the Old Testament who had been tasked with making the Israelites fall by the king Balaq)
- Others follow the doctrines of the Nicolaites a group of people that admittedly is acting wrong and Jesus doesn't like.
