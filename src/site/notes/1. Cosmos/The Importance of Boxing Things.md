# Mini-Essay ~ The Importance of Boxing Things (Language Learning)

So recently, I have been slacking a bit with my language learning, and as I was working on that made an unexpected breakthrough.

I know this already--since I am me, lel--but for my astronauts, I am poly-literate in French, English, Spanish and Japanese. Obviously level of skills vary across languages, French being my strongest and my weakest being either Spanish, but I am at a level where I can read/speak to some degree of fluency in all of them. 

Why did I felt compelled to write about the importance of boxing things? Recently, as I cut through wade of material for [[MAT3375(X) ~ Regression Analysis\|MAT3375(X) ~ Regression Analysis]] and [[MAT3172 Foundations of Probability\|MAT3172 Foundations of Probability]], two classes which are as complex as they are interesting, I have rekindled my love for reading manga. This being the reason for which I started learning Japanese in the first place, I mulled on it.

So... what you ask?

Wait, I am getting there. For the longest time, Spanish had remained at a usable level where I didn't care to improve it further. After all, all my Spanish-speaking friends spoke fluent English or French (or both) and learning a language is tough. It didn't help that I didn't feel compelled to do anything in Spanish. While Spanish as always felt like a pretty low hanging fruit to unlock new [[DLC\|DLC]] of the world, I never actually sat down to practice for more than a few weeks at time in a serious manner. 

Until... MANWHAS!

Yea, this surprised me too. I discovered that webtoons and manwhas had Spanish translations. Shocker! 

All of a sudden, I had something natural to do in Spanish. While not native to any Spanish-speaking country, reading manwhas is something that fits neatly in my life, moreover it's fun! So fun in fact that I have been finding myself justifying wasting in bed to read them--after all it's language practice! 

Over the past few days, I have spent more time reading in Spanish than I have spent over the past year, and I want more. And that is the lesson.

Languages, like most things that are worth their salt, are fruits that are hard to grow. Japanese has always felt like a cinch because anime, manga, light and visual novels were **naturally** interesting to me...

I am really exposing myself as a weeb, uh? 

Point is, even though Japanese is arguably much harder--and I did eat shit a few times--I have spent hours and continue to spend hours immersed in it. And this with barely any "conventional" studying. I am not pera-pera yet, but I can do what I set out to do which was watch anime and read light novels relatively comfortably. I have also had conversations with Japanese natives and got jouzued (a long-held dream of mine.)

Point is, to hell with standards, and stigma! If you want to learn something, especially something hard like languages, you need to find a use that resonates with YOU and that makes sense to YOU. And you need to find a spot for it, or **make one**.

Currently, for me with Spanish, that use is reading manwhas. I started a challenge with my brothers and in a week from now we will only be allowed to speak to each other using Spanish (at least that's the plan). [[1. Cosmos/UltraLearning\|UltraLearning]], amirite?

But that's because it's what makes sense for ME.

Therefore if you want to acquire *that* skill--whichever one came to mind--you better find a natural slot in your life for it.

If you fail to do so, failure and disappointment will certainly jump you JJK-style at the first sign of weakness.

To conclude,
*Voy a ser un jodidamente asombroso poliglota y lo seré sin estudiar, solo voy a leer y escuchar lo que quiera. Muchas gracias por leer este artículo.*
