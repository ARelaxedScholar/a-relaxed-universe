# Optimisation

The aim to take a function and find the values which maximize or minimize the function.

The catch is that sometimes we want to enforce that that solution is an integer. Other times we actually have a really high dimensional function for which there is no convenient technique to find a global maximum/minimum.

Other times, we are actually trying to optimize multiple objectives. In a multiobjective optimization problem, there is no reason to assume that because a solution is great in either region, it will be great for us.
