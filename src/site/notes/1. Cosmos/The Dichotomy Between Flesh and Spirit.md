# The Dichotomy Between Flesh and Spirit ~ 3rd Person Introspective without Feeling Schizophrenic
## A page out of the Buddhist's Book
I have heard from the buddhists that your desires, are not yours. And that "you" as a concept is nothing more than a illusion, for that reason you cannot succeed in reaching true happiness, without abandoning that illusion.

While this has a lot of good things, like gaining control over your emotions by realizing that they are not "your" emotions and that "you" or whatever the thing is that is driving the fleshly mech-suit is does not have to be joustled by them. But I have a few problems about it that I will cover at some point in [[Dying Two Yourself ~ Christianity vs Buddhism\|Dying Two Yourself ~ Christianity vs Buddhism]]

One thing I like about the Christian idea of [[What Exactly Is The Flesh?\|flesh]] and [[The Spirit\|spirit]] and the dichotomy between the two, is that as far as I am concerned it feels much more practical. It takes a lot more to accept that "you" as a thing is naught more than a illusion and that as long as you cling to it you are destined to suffer, than to accept the notion that at in your body you have two things vying for control and whichever you let take over, will take over.

Why? Because the latter does not really have much to accept. If anything it's just a recontextualization of a reality that many have already experienced. It is not a cope out for responsibility after all **you** are still the one choosing whom you're listening to, but at the same time **you** can look at yourself objectively and retrospectively.

Here "listening" is not literal voices in your head. I mean it might be for you, but that's not what I am talking about. I am talking in the same sense as in "he did something in anger", or "he was thinking with his dick".

They are still doing the thinking, but they let themselves be lead by the wrong thing.
A more modern interpretation that literally everyone is familiar with (at least in the occident), is the idea of the devil and angel on your shoulders suggesting thoughts and actions.

In the end you choose who to listen to, but you are not the one thinking those things. At least not in the most important sense of the word. Let's get into that.
## You Are Not The One Thinking?
This is not a metaphysical statement. You can believe in demons, and spirits and whatever; this is besides the point.

When I say you are not the one thinking, I am putting a demarcation between "a fleeting thought" and "something you actually consider".

You, is the you are that knows better. That does shit and then regret it, "post-nut clarity" style. The one that gives advice to others that makes you go "damn, I actually said that"?
Why? Because in all of those times, you are actually poised, you take the time to think about what just happened, you filter the scraps and make [[Alchemy\|Alchemy]] with your thoughts... Imma watch FMA at some point.

In secular terms, the spirit could be seen as the [[Subconscious\|Subconscious]] and the flesh would be your primal ooga-booga brain. 

In religious terms, the spirit would be the [[Breath of God\|Breath of God]], the [[Spirit of God that Hovered over the Waters\|Spirit of God that Hovered over the Waters]], the thing that can get "connect" with the [[Infinity\|Infinity]] that [[God\|God]] represents, and the flesh is your fallen nature, the [[Natural Body\|Natural Body]] that leads you to do the bad that you don't want to do, and detracts you from doing the good that you do want to do.

Whichever one inspires you more choose it. I suggest the latter.

Point is, the Bible makes a clear distinction between the thing that happens in your mind. 

## Why that Distinction?
One very simple reason, it gives you perspective.
2 Corinthians 10:5 tells us "We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make obedient to Christ." I think I will write a note at some point about [[How To Make Every Thought Captive\|How To Make Every Thought Captive]].

So, our thoughts are important. We shouldn't repress them! But at the same time, not all thoughts are breathed equal.
The thought of "let's masturbate right now, we got nothing to do anyways" is not to be held to the same standard as "have I been livi
So, our thoughts are important. We shouldn't repress them! ng according to my purpose?", "is that new thing worth pursuing or is it just a distraction?"

How do you make that distinction? By analyzing the source. Typically, all the stuff that is sinful is clearly from your flesh.

I really like this litmus test that some pastor on Tiktok (I haven't used Tiktok for a while so I don't have his name, srry). Would maintaining that thought, would entertaining that thought be glorifying God, or would it be glorifying the devil. 

Sometimes, things that sound sensible when analyzed through that lens no longer seem good. 

But it is really difficult to have perspective, if you see all thoughts as coming from you. Inherently since they come from you, you will want to defend them. Even things you know are wrong, you'll try to justify.

Being able to label the source of one thought will help you to catch yourself when you start to do that.
