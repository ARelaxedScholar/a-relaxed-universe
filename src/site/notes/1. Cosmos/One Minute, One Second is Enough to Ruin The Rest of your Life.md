# One Minute, One Second is Enough to Ruin The Rest of your Life

This is related to king Ozias who lived in glory and walked in front of the Lord.

But he dared burn encense to God, in a location where only sacrificators are allowed to do so.

God gave him a chance, a warning so to speak in the sacrificators coming to him and telling him that what he was doing was not good. 

He refused to listen, and felt irritation in his heart. That very moment God struck him with leprosy on the forehead.

From that moment onwards he was a leper. 

He walked with God, but one moment, one action, on second was sufficient to ruin his heritage.

Don't let your ego fool you. Know your place. Be careful of what you say, of how you say it, of what you do and how you do it.

**Don't be a fool.**

One related consequence of failing to be careful:
[[1. Cosmos/The shame of missing out on one's due\|The shame of missing out on one's due]]

2 Chronicles 26
