# Eigenvector
A **non-zero** vector for which, the following equation holds.
$$ Ax = \lambda x$$
Where $\lambda$ is a number. And $x$ is a **non-zero** vector. 
0 cannot be an eigenvector, but is contained in all the [[1. Cosmos/Eigenspace\|eigenspaces]].

The why is that 0-eigenvector makes the relation trivial.

They live in [[1. Cosmos/Eigenspace\|eigenspaces]].
