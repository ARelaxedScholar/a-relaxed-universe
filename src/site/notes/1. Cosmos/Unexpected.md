The paper mask has spoken,

Listen

CHORUS (0:14)
I just dropped a M, on some land. (Cap)
Tryna flip the thang, tryna plant a tree 
Grow some money for the fam.

Beam, Flash McQueen
MR2, Racing down the street.
Things, I shouldn't do.
But I can, but I can

(0;27)
I am there paving the way. *uh* I don't care what they say. yuh
Up at 6, grinding before the sun's up. Working, busting my ass for a come up.
Out a-ll day, grinding, praying to find my way. Like a wolf pulling a sleigh. cuh
Got one life, one chance, gotta make it, yeah.
I don't care if you can't take it
Fake it till you make it, uh.
I don't got it, to fake it, yuh.yuh.
You and I are different|  but the same
Two overgrown kids, playing the same game
Feel the beast howling, feed the flame.

Keep it tame, keep it tame.

I need some energy, that divine liturgy.
Make me sing, make me cling, I want to feel the synergy.
Make me dream...
I need some sleep, I want some money, (1:01)
I need water turned into wine, something sweet, some honey.

CHORUS (1:07)
I just dropped a M, on some land.
Tryna flip the thang, tryna plant a tree 
Grow some money for the fam.

Beam, Flash McQueen
MR2, Racing down the street.
Things, I shouldn't do.
But I am, I am.



(Ah) (1:20)
I don't know what else to say. You thought I'd give it all away.
Eyes on the goal, no blinking, can't stop now. Nitro down the street, shi I'm so loud. (We lit)
Eye of a killer, hands of a sinner, 
doing what it takes, to be the winner
My parents fought hard so that'd I'd be good.
So I am just out, doing what I should.

Deuteronomy, eyes to the sky, aligning the stars, some astronomy.
Looking for guidance, for a way. A cup of coffee, four a day.
Can't be mediocre, gotta be great. Black or white, don't see no gray.
(I'll take it all)

(1:47)
Take it all, take it all, take it all, we gon ball.
Don't get it twisted. We're having fun, but our lives on the line now, not talkng bout guns.
This is a warning, a courtesy call, don't stand with us, if you won't give your all
Don't stand with us now, if you haven't learned yet, how you're supposed to break a fall.

CHORUS (1:07)
I just dropped a M, on some land.
Tryna flip the thang, tryna plant a tree 
Grow some money for the fam.

Beam, Flash McQueen
MR2, Racing down the street.
Things, I shouldn't do.
But I do, I do

I just dropped a M, on some land.
Tryna flip the thang, tryna plant a tree 
Grow some money for the fam.

Beam, Flash McQueen
MR2, Racing down the street.
Things, I shouldn't do.
But I do, I do
