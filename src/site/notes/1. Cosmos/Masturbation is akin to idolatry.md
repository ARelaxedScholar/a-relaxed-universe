# Masturbation is akin to idolatry

As a Christian one should put God's word above all things. One thing that the bible is really vocal about is the problem of lust, dynasties fell because of someone who couldn't control his dick.

Recently (maybe even today), I had a dream where I am talking platonically to a girl and dad pops up and ask me angrily "What did I tell you about girls?" I dismissed it in the moment cause nothing weird was happening, but it's true that something could have been happening.

God does not like us having lust on women (real or otherwise ) to whom we are not married, since this drive is something he gave us for the sake of procreation and bonding with our significant other.

This, when one masturbates and goes against God's will in such a manner, he both puts his own will and masturbation above God. In a sense, he worships himself and his own pleasure over what God wants of him. This cannot be sustained.

And one might experience [[1. Cosmos/The shame of missing out on one's due\|The shame of missing out on one's due]] because of it. One should be careful about everything that enters his eye and his mind as to make sure he is not tempted towards those things.

If he is tempted, he should not linger on the thought and consider it as is. But should see it for what it is, a temptation of the enemy. Then he should find some way to think about something else (talking to others, exercise, work, etc.) In the first place, if you have enough free time to consider doing that, it's not a good thing. You should be always working toward actualizing yourself and manifesting God's purpose into your life.
