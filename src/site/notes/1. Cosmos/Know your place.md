This is about the king Ozias, a king who became such at 16. Did great things for the Lord and walked as God desired him to, until he let his arrogance go out of bound and
burned incense for the Lord (a task that only sacrificators can do), when he was admonished he had the gall to be irritated and God punished him for it.

Hadn't he done that, he could have died in glory likely. But this simple action, ruined him. He became a leper for the rest of his life.

He missed out on the glory that was likely still ahead and had to leave his throne for his son,  Jotham, just because he couldn't control his ego.

There is first the reminder that many actions can lead to [[1. Cosmos/The shame of missing out on one's due\|The shame of missing out on one's due]] and that thus one should be careful.

But the one thing that's even more telling is how [[1. Cosmos/One Minute, One Second is Enough to Ruin The Rest of your Life\|One Minute, One Second is Enough to Ruin The Rest of your Life]].

2 Chronicles 26
