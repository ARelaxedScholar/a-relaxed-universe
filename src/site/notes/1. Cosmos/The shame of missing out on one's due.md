# The shame of missing out on one's due

We see Joas beeing an ungrateful pos. He abandons the God who gave him peace, he kills Zachary the son of Jehojada (a man who did good for him), and he didn't repent.

God punishes him by making him be defeated by a small army (Syrian) and die from a conspiracy (the same way he killed Zachary ).

Result, he dies a king but isn't buried in the cemetery of kings. Dies destitute in life, and robbed of his kingly privilege in death.

2 Chronicles 24

Lesson: Do not abandon the Lord and always repent when you sin. But more related to this note's title, DO NOT SPOIL YOUR DESTINY due to lust/pettiness/other things of the kind. Be straightforward in the Lord.
