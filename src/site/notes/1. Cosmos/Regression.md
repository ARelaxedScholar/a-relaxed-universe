# Regression
## Why?
Well in life, especially as a scientist and a statistician, or even a probability guy (whatever they are called), there will be things that are harder to measure, or things that we want to induce, and other things that are easier to measure or things that we can easily manipulate (or at least more easily than the alternative.) 

For that reason, regression is crucial because it is the mathematical science that concerns itself with how to find the relations between various variables so that we can do what's called [[1. Cosmos/Inference\|Inference]].
