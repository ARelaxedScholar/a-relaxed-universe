## Chapter 1 ~ Introduction (Lesson 1)
[[Walter Pitts: An Eccentric Genius?\|Walter Pitts: An Eccentric Genius?]]

Scientists are somewhat retarded and unable to read through a book. While to be fair, if I was reading about a revolutionary invention and half way through I learned it couldn't do basic stuff I'd want it to do, I'd likely put the book back as well, still. Two decades setback for AI! This was so that I could get in the industry in time, thank you God. I will not waste this time.

This one chapter gives a foray into the subjects of [[Computer Vision\|Computer Vision]], [[Segmentation\|Segmentation]], [[Tabular Models\|Tabular Models]], and [[Collaborative Filtering\|Collaborative Filtering]].

Each of these subjects are not presented in depth, but code is provided to implement a state-of-the-art version of the model that can be used on our own data if modified.

It also presses the importance of splitting your dataset into a [[1. Cosmos/Validation Set\|Validation Set]], [[Training Set\|Training Set]], and even a [[Test Set\|Test Set]] while the first two are mandatory, the latter is STRONGLY recommended.
