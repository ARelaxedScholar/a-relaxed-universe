# When You're Not Ready for your Task

**Cue (Source of the Idea)** : 2 Chronicles 29

**Context (Optional)** : In the same text that is talked about in [[1. Cosmos/All It Takes is One Good Leader.\|All It Takes is One Good Leader.]] during the celebration the sacrificators are not ready for their task.

**Content** : Levites are holy people among the israelites. Sacrificators as well (they might be one and the same but I am not sure), while the Levites hurried to sanctification and were ready when Ezechias on the spur of the moment suggested sacrifices to the people, the sacrificators weren't and were still scrambling to get ready. Result, the Levites whose role it likely isn't (usually) to help with sacrifices (since the bible mentions it), stepped in to help their brothers since the number of holocausts was too big, and the number of sacrificators was too small.

This feels related to the idea of [[1. Cosmos/The shame of missing out on one's due\|The shame of missing out on one's due]] but in responsibilities. While it's not quite a reward, one's responsibility is integral to their role. But as a sacrificator there were people that were responsible of that role, being so lacking that someone has to take over/supplement in your role is a shame as well.
