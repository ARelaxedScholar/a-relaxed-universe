# Wheat and Chaff
A man sows wheat, in the night a ruffian comes and sows chaff (a plant that is almost indistinguishible from wheat). Even if it was distinguishible, removing the seeds of chaff would also disturb and in the end remove the seeds of the wheat too.

> [!Bible]-
> 24. He put another parable before them, saying,  “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field,
> 25. but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds  among the wheat and went away.
> 26. So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.
> 27. And the servants  of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’
> 28. He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So the servants said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’
> 29. But he said, ‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them.
> 30. Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, “Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”

## Strategies of the devil.
This is one of the well known parables of Jesus, which does two things.

First it tells us that the enemy is not straightforward, he doesn't come against us like a giant with strength and monstrosity (he could do that I guess too, but stick with me) but he is the father of lies and evil. Instead of frontally attacking you and risking the retribution of God (symbolized here by attacking during the day when the farmer is awake and has many people to defend him), he waits at night, a moment of weakness to put his plan in execution.

In a similar manner, the devil and his goons can't do anything against you when you're spiritually awake, vigilant and rooted in the word of God. But as soon as you fall asleep spiritually (stop reading the Bible, stop praying, fall to sin) you fall to weakness and open a door for the devil to act and do his deeds. God is merciful and will help you if you ask for forgiveness and come back to him, and can even revert the consequences instantly, but if we take the Bible as reference typically even when forgiven one still has to live with the consequences of his actions. 

Take David who lost the child that resulted from his illicit union with Bethshebah. He prayed and fasted and was forgiven, but God didn't spare him the loss of that child; loss that he had already pronounced as David's punishment for his deed.

## Hell and Judgement Day

The conclusion of this parable which has been ommitted here shows the man simply accepting the fact that at the moment decimating the chaff would also decimate the wheat, and that he will wait. For the day when the wheat has grown to maturity to separate the chaff from the wheat and burn and burn what has to be burn  -- preserving the rest. This is one of the aforementioned usage of fire in [[1. Cosmos/Stuff about fire and Jesus\|Stuff about fire and Jesus]] burning what has to be burned.

> [!Bible]-
> 12. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”

  [Matthew 3:12 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/40/3/)

In a similar manner, we as christians are the wheat and among us are people that call themselves christian and that might even sound christian at times, but in some clear or unclear ways stray from the word. Maybe christians who claim to be such but also say LGBT is right and supported by God (directly contradicting the Bible), or those who claim to be christians but twist the word to support their desires or their theology, those that claim to be christian but who act as they want, and most tragic of them all, those who claim to be christian and act as christian but by pure religion without a true faith in Jesus and his sacrifice. So they look saved, they might even preach the word to others in such a way that they are saved, but they themselves are not saved.

We must pray God for that to not be our share. 

Clearly God cannot cleanse the church right now, after all how shaken would the church be if those that claim to be christian and that might very well appear like good christian were to start falling left and right. Not only that wouldn't it be something that pushes unbelievers away from God?

Oh look at the christians dropping like flies... they'd likely say.

This is why the judgement of true christians and everyone else will happen on judgement day, and even big pastors chasing demons in Jesus' name will go to fire if they happened to be chaff all along.
