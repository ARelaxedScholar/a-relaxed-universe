# Probability Spaces
Probability Spaces are triple $(\varOmega, \mathscr F, P)$ or in other words sample spaces equipped with a $\sigma-$algebra to which we have attached a [[1. Cosmos/Probability Measure (According to Kolmogorov)\|probability measure]]. They are a special case of [[Measure Space\|measure spaces]] where the measure is a probability measure.
