# Chapter 4 ~ Intro to NLP
Honestly for this one I didn't learn much. It was mostly review of stuff I already knew. Graphing data is important, learning steps are important, yadda yadda yadda.

To make sure I understand what is happening it would be a good idea to try to train the model from scratch, on my own. To better understand what's happening.

At the very least, this gave me an introduction to using pretrained models, in HuggingFace. Not sure if this is what UMLFit is, but oh well.
