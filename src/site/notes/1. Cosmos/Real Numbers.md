# Real Numbers
Real numbers are "in a sense" the simplest set of elements.

First complete field of elements.

Make cards about field axioms of real numbers.

### Lemma 1.2:
$$
\text{If }a,b\in \mathbb{R} \text{ with } a<b \text{, then there exists a real number } c \text{ such that } a<c<b. 
$$
Proof: By constructio, you can always do $\frac{a+b}{2}$ and it will fall between the two numbers.
