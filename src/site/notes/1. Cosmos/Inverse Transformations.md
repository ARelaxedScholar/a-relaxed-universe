# Inverse Transformations
It's a really cool result that shows that as long as some cdf is continuous, it is possible to sample from it through a uniform distribution.

Let $F(x)$ be the cdf such that it is **injective**, find $F^{-1}(x)$ and then plug a  uniform distribution from $[0,1]$ in there and boom, even though you sampled from a uniform distribution, through that process you can mathemagically sample from any continuous distribution trivially.
