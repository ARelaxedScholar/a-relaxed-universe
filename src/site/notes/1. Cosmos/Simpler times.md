Remember glades, strong winds running right past us.
Back when, we didn't drive gas cars. 
My eyes way up high, dreaming up stories.
My eyes way up high, dreaming up stories.

Running through the grass, slaying up dragons.
Oddly-shaped stick as our only weapons.
Our eyes right ahead, living the stories.
Our eyes right ahead, making history.

Why did we change? Why did we fall? Was growing up worth it all? 
In the end, equivalent exchange, we lost alchemy, some vitality, to become older.
Remember when, remember how, the world became so banal.
It seems that maturity, just means shouldering the weight of the world on your shoulder.

Become older, just become older. You gotta shoulder. 
Become older, just become older. You gotta shoulder.

Back-left corner of the class, looking outside.
Dreams of being something, of being a guide.
Someone great, for another me, younger.
Someone great, someone that always conquers.

Head in my notebooks, sketching adventures
A pen in my hand, cause I like dangerous.
Been a while, since I sketched anything.
Been a while, don't remember me stopping.

When did I change? I don't recall? Should I blame puberty for it it all? 
Back then, would have lost a leg, maybe my two feet, if it meant that I could draw longer.
My interests changed, simple I know. Can hear my father's "I told you so."
Did I lose, you can pick or choose. Don't know how to feel. Let it simmer, till the feeling taste stronger. 

Become stronger, just become stronger. You have to shoulder. (you have to stronger. yeah) 
Become older, just become older. Gotta be stronger.

I don't remember signing away. The right to live, the right to play.
Seeing embers of a glorious past, now times' just too fast. How much can I last?
Always so tired, where is the fire, where is the flame that used to burn.
Want to enjoy my life, before I die, before I end up as dust again... in the urn.
