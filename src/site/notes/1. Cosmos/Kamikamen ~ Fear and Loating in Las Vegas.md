# Kamikamen ~ Fear and Loating in Las Vegas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv-HqdZM7lk
(Properly split the song into song part, copy King song structure)
Blood thumping through my veins.
My stomach still growing when I inhale
I lost my way to a white cell.
Alive, but am I living? I can't tell.

At crossroads, my feet bound up by chains 
Swallowing thorns as if under a spell. 
I am but a rose, without the smell

Too many dreams, too many worries,
I can't stand.
Too many voices, too many choices
Uncertain
Where do I start, where the world ends.
I'm too bland.
Answer my prayer, I want to return
To Neverland

I lost a bet a while ago.
The price was self-respect, debt I still owe.
Melting away, I am just the snow.
 
# Chorus
Drowning unrest and loathing with laziness.
Can't fail, if I never tried, 
I won this game. 
Haha, I lied | If I am to live this way, it means I died.
Drowning unrest and loathing with laziness.
Trading self-respect for your pride.
A cheap shot, but one with a certain allure
Won't be mocked, nor remembered, that's for sure. (Yeah!)
# Bridge (1:35)
I see the sun, shining so bright | I am here down low.
Arose from... my slumber |  I am just the snow.
I want to take my time, want to take it slow
But the clock ticks, tocks and the time follows.

Leaving me behind, like I'm a ghost. Like I am a ghost. Like I am ghost.

The highs and lows, the pains and throes
A little snowflake, died of an overdose.
I was not special after all. 
Just to hang on, got addicted to adder-all.

A scentless rose, a dirty snow, a wingless bird,
What else I don't know.

Next winter I'll return, yeah, I'll be stronger.

# Chorus (2:07)
Drowning unrest and loathing with laziness.
Can't fail, if I never tried, 
I won this game. 
Haha, I lied. | If I am living this way, then I died. (Oh)
Drowning unrest and loathing with laziness.
Thrashing self-respect and your life.
You'll live to regret it, I can assure (but)
If you're dead, might as well just be a bot.
