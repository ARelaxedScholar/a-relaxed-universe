# Kamikamen ~ Fear and Loating in Las Vegas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv-HqdZM7lk
Blood thumping through my veins.
My stomach still growing when I inhale
I lost my way to a white cell.
Alive, but am I living? I can't tell.

At crossroads, my feet bound up by chains 
Swallowing thorns as if under a spell. 
I am but a rose, without the smell

Too many dreams, too many worries,
I can't stand.
Too many voices, too many choices
Uncertain
Where do I start, where the world ends.
I'm too bland.
Answer my prayer, I want to return
To Neverland

I lost a bet a while ago.
The price was self respect, debt I still owe
Withering away, I am just the snow.
 
# Chorus
The pain, the fear, the guilt, (yeah) they're my weak-uh-ness
I stormed in hell for those that died.
If not for pride, she'd still be my side (oh)
If not for my pride, she'd still be alive (so)

Spectres haunting my mind, makin me delirious
Ether is (Etherious) a hell of a drug.
Flying too close to the flames, a boy, a bug (oh)
Death's a sly mistres-, "why not die in a buzz?"

# Bridge (1:35)
I see the sun, shining so bright | I am here down low.
Arose from... my slumber |  I am just the snow.
I want to take my time, want to take it slow
But the clock ticks, tocks and the time follows.

Leaving me behind, like I'm a ghost. Like I am a ghost. Like I am ghost.

The highs and lows, the pains and throes
A little snowflake, died of an overdose.
I was not special after all. 
My boundless confidence in the end caused her fall.

A scentless rose, a dirty snow, a wingless bird,
What else I don't know.

Next winter I'll return, yeah, I'll be stronger.

# Chorus (2:07)
The pain, the fear, the guilt, (yeah) they're my wit-uh-ness
I stormed in hell for those that died.
If not for pride, she'd still be my side (oh)
If not for my pride, she'd still be alive (so)

Spectres haunting my mind, but I’m furious  
Ether is (Etherious) a hell of a drug.  
Rising from frost and flames, I’ve killed the bug (oh)  
Winter’s my season; I'll be victorious
