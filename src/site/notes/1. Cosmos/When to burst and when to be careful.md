# When to burst and when to be careful

Cue : placing the dishes in the machine

Context : Was placing new Japanese stuff (dishes) that the parents bought in the washing machine.

As I was doing that, placing the dishes I took one handful of dishes placed them as one unit and then split the thing. It worked perfectly, tried to do the same with bigger dishes suddenly it didn't work.

Funnily enough this sounds like a perfect analogy. When multiple things are to be done, but they are all small enough, combining them all into one big thing and crushing **that** might be a good idea.

But, once the task passes a certain threshold (which is likely relative to the task to be done and your own level of skill), then it is likely wiser to take it slowly. One challenge at a time.
