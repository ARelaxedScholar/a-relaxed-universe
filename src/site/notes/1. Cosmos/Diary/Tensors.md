# Tensors

Tensors are a physicists' answer to the problem of [[Invariance\|invariance]] of physical measures for complex physical phenomena. 

For physics to be useful, we  need it to behave the same and be consistent no matter the frame of reference in such a way that two individuals even from different species if intelligent enough to measure them according to their native measures would still reach the same constants when everything is accounted for.

The problem is that while this is relatively simple for simple concepts like velocity which is often introduced as a single quantity and is then shown to actually be a vector (rank 1 Tensor), this is not at all obvious when dealing with concepts which are inherently multidimensional like viscosity or whatnot and for which extension to higher dimensions would require much more than simple vectors.

Saying that tensors are invariant is not quite true. What is true instead is that they change in a very specific way in such a way that through an operation called a [[Change of Basis\|change of basis]] it is trivial to take any insights from one coordinate system to another. 

Under this definition, numbers, vectors, matrices, and beyond just become different ranks of tensors, respectively $0,1,2, \dots$.

There are three types of tensors:
- [[Covariant\|Covariant]] (Recto)
- [[Contravariant\|Contravariant]] (Verso)
- [[Mixed\|Mixed]] (One example is the [[Metric Tensor\|Metric Tensor]] which acts as the bridge between Covariant and Contravariant.)t
