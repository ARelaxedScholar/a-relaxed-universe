# What you decree

We often hear in the God-less world interesting ideas like the [[Law of Attraction\|Law of Attraction]], the concept that [[Words have Power\|Words have Power]], etc. etc.

The Bible and Christianity have a strong emphasis on the importance of the spoken language and the [[Logos\|Logos]] as well. After all, the world was created through God speaking it into being, and Jesus's title besides being the Son and the lamb, is also one of being the Word (Logos) that was there at the beginning.

Words are extremely powerful even without the supernatural. They like drawings and colors are components of some language that when seen or heard make us imagine things. Words are uniquely so that each unit (unless we talk determinants and stuff) have meaning in itself, and on its own might be able to provoke some idea. 

The way you speak of yourself, and the way you speak of others, is a huge representation of your own psyche and of what you will be able to achieve. The Bible takes it a step further, your words have an actual impact on the metaphysical, and you should be careful of what you say. Strong faith one way or another could cause negative prophecies to become self-fulfilling.

When it comes to children, this is exacerbated. Kids come in this world through you. As a result there is a special bond that exists between a parent and their progeny. A daughter who hears from her father that she is pretty will not care about anything she might hear outside, likewise a daughter that never hear those words will likely lack the confidence to stand up to reproach outside, and will crave those words from whomever she can get them. A son that is always reproached for being masculine will hide away their divine masculine in order to please their parents, a son that is instead brought up properly with awareness of their potential for destruction, with respect for it rather than fear will become a strong pillar for whichever community they happen to find themselves in.

A parent that always decree bad things on their children is not helping them at all. From a children's POV, there aren't many things more powerful than the words of a parent and being consistently told that one will fail or will amount to nothing is not helpful at all. It does not help that since failure is a part of everyone's path to success, the eventual failures that such a child will encounter as they develop will reinforce their negative ideas about themselves and potentially lead them to never succeed even if with the right priming these failures would have become the stepping stone towards generational success. 

"Yeah my parents were right," they'll say as they work a job they hate, going back to an empty home and drink themselves to sleep. 

Feeling terrible for doing it, but bringing into existence what their parent had decreed. In more ways than one, parents are those that give a framework of what is possible to their children. Some do manage to exit that framework, but it is an herculean task for most. Simply because that framework is installed into a children's psyche at the age where they are learning the "truths" of the world.

Everything I said about the supernatural power of words still apply here, except that the Bible tells us that God gives special importance to the words of a parent over their children because, well they are their children. So double reason to be super careful of what you say. Do not curse your children, as it will come to pass.

When we take Jacob and Esau, despite the fact that Jacob stole the blessing that was promised to his brother. The fact his father had pronounced these words over him, God honored them and did not even punish Jacob for it. Even when Isaac realizes what happened he doubles down saying that Jacob had already received his blessing and that surely it would come to pass.

Be careful of what you say to everyone; especially your kids.
