# Caratheodarry's Extension Theorem
Informally, it's a theorem that states that:
Say we have an [[1. Cosmos/Algebra\|algebra]] $\varXi$ defined on a sample space $\varOmega$ with some pseudo-measure $P_0$ (really just a function) that maps $\varXi$ to the interval $[0,1]$ in such a way that:
- $P_0(\varOmega) = 1$
- $P_0$ is countably additive (if it so happen that the countable union of sets in $\varXi$ is in $\varXi$)

Then it is uniquely extensible (as is there is exactly one [[1. Cosmos/Probability Measure (According to Kolmogorov)\|actual probability measure]]) such that for that probability measure $P$:
$$
P_0(A)=P(A) \text{, for any } A \text{ element of the } \sigma-\text{algebra under consideration}
$$
Note that at no point did we say that $\varXi$ had to be a $\sigma-$algebra itself, hence the idea of extension.
