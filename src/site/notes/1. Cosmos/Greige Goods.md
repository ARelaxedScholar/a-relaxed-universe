# Greige Goods

It's the state at which a yarn has been weaved into [[1. Cosmos/Yardage\|Yardage]]. It is not finished, cleaned, colored or anything. 

This cannot be used in a final piece. These greige goods require a lot more treatment (bleaching, scouring (cleaning), etc.) for them to be used. 

The Greige Goods will be sent to Finishing mills whose role will be to transform the greige goods into usable stuff.

After finishing a greige good can either become a [[PFP - Prepared for Printing\|PFP - Prepared for Printing]] or a [[PFD - Prepared for Dying\|PFD - Prepared for Dying]].

*\Note at the end of the Finishing Process, a greige good will be white.
