# Physical world and Spiritual World

*So* everything we see in the physical world also exists in the spiritual world. 
This is a good thing as it can imply that anything we can formulate and see in our spirits can also be manifested in the real world, which is from where comes a lot of [[New Age\|New Age]] practices such as manifestation.

But on the reverse, the enemy can provoke stuff in the spiritual world, plant stuff in the spiritual world and impedes one's life in the physical realm. After all Ephesians 6:12 

> [!Bible]-
> 12. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
> 
  [Ephesians 6:12 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/49/6/)
